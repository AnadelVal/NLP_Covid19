In the past several years, the management of these patients has advanced, with new information about the natural history and prognosis of illness, the utility of serum markers to guide management, the use of appropriate clinical tools to guide the site-of-care decision, and the finding that guidelines can be developed in a way that improves patient outcome. The challenges to patient management include the emergence of new pathogens and the progression of antibiotic resistance in some of the common pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. Few new antimicrobial treatment options are available, and the utility of some new therapies has been limited by drug-related toxicity. Ancillary care for severe pneumonia with activated protein C and corticosteroids is being studied, but recently, inpatient care has been most affected by the development of evidence-based “core measures” for management that have been promoted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which form the basis for the public reporting of hospital performance in CAP care.</p><br/><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(20)30558-4\" target=\"_blank\">Comorbidities and multi-organ injuries in the treatment of COVID-19</a><p>“We now have a name for the disease caused by coronavirus and it's COVID-19”, said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO on Feb 11, 2020.1 WHO recently updated the name novel coronavirus pneumonia, previously named by Chinese scientists,2 to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). More attention should be paid to comorbidities in the treatment of COVID-19. In the literature, COVID-19 is characterised by the symptoms of viral pneumonia such as fever, fatigue, dry cough, and lymphopenia. Many of the older patients who become severely ill have evidence of underlying illness such as cardiovascular disease, liver disease, kidney disease, or malignant tumours.3, 4, 5 These patients often die of their original comorbidities; we therefore need to accurately evaluate all original comorbidities of individuals with COVID-19. In addition to the risk of group transmission of an infectious disease, we should pay full attention to the treatment of the original comorbidities of the individual while treating pneumonia, especially in older patients with serious comorbid conditions. Not only capable of causing pneumonia, COVID-19 may also cause damage to other organs such as the heart, the liver, and the kidneys, as well as to organ systems such as the blood and the immune system.3, 4, 5 Patients eventually die of multiple organ failure, shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, heart failure, arrhythmias, and renal failure.5, 6 We should therefore pay attention to potential multi-organ injuries and the protection and prevention thereof in the treatment of COVID-19. • View related content for this article We took over a ward for the centralised treatment of severely ill patients in Wuhan Tongji Hospital. 60 patients were classified into three types during their treatment. 13 [22%] of 60 patients mainly had pneumonia and were classified as type A. Basic treatments were provided, such as antivirals, antibiotics, oxygen therapy, and glucocorticoids. 33 (55%) of 60 patients were type B, with disease that manifested with different degrees of pneumonia, accompanied by serious comorbidities. For patients classified as type B, we continued to monitor the changes of comorbidities while managing the pneumonia, carrying out individual evaluations and developing specific treatment plans, including antihypertensives, hypoglycaemic therapy, and continuous renal replacement therapy. 14 (23%) of 60 patients were critically ill and were classified as type C. Patients classified as type C had disease that was considered to have developed from the aggravation of disease seen either in type A or type B, when early therapeutic effects for type A disease were unsatisfactory (resulting in multiple organ injuries), or when disease associated with type B became aggravated and the patient's condition deteriorated from their original comorbidities (leading to multiple organ failure). Attention should be paid to organ function in these critically ill patients and necessary protective measures, including mechanical ventilation, glucocorticoids, antivirals, symptomatic treatments, and anti-shock therapy. We believe that the classification of COVID-19 in severe patients could help in individual evaluation of the disease and would provide effective triage for the treatment and management of individual patients. We declare no competing interests.</p><br/><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100111\" target=\"_blank\">COVID-19 in pregnancy: early lessons</a><p>Abstract As the worldwide incidence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly increases, there remains limited information on COVID-19 in pregnancy. We present here our experience with an initial seven cases of confirmed COVID-19 in pregnancy presenting to a single large New York City tertiary care hospital. Five of the seven patients presented with symptoms of COVID-19, including cough, myalgias, fevers, chest pain, and headache. Four patients were admitted to the hospital, including two who required supportive care with intravenous hydration. Most notably, the other two admitted patients were asymptomatic on admission to the hospital, presenting instead for obstetrically-indicated labor inductions; both of these patients became symptomatic post-partum, each requiring intensive care unit admission.</p><br/><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2011.11.014\" target=\"_blank\">Does empirical treatment of community-acquired pneumonia with fluoroquinolones delay tuberculosis treatment and result in fluoroquinolone resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis? Controversies and solutions</a><p>Abstract The role of fluoroquinolones (FQs) as empirical therapy for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains controversial in countries with high tuberculosis (TB) endemicity owing to the possibility of delayed TB diagnosis and treatment and the emergence of FQ resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although the rates of macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid-resistant Haemophilus influenzae have risen to alarming levels, the rates of respiratory FQ (RFQ) resistance amongst these isolates remain relatively low. It is reported that ca. 1–7% of CAP cases are re-diagnosed as pulmonary TB in Asian countries. A longer duration (≥7 days) of symptoms, a history of night sweats, lack of fever (>38°C), infection involving the upper lobe, presence of cavitary infiltrates, opacity in the lower lung without the presence of air, low total white blood cell count and the presence of lymphopenia are predictive of pulmonary TB. Amongst patients with CAP who reside in TB-endemic countries who are suspected of having TB, imaging studies as well as aggressive microbiological investigations need to be performed early on. Previous exposure to a FQ for >10 days in patients with TB is associated with the emergence of FQ-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates. However, rates of M. tuberculosis isolates with FQ resistance are significantly higher amongst multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis isolates than amongst susceptible isolates. Consequently, in Taiwan and also in other countries with TB endemicity, a short-course (5-day) regimen of a RFQ is still recommended for empirical therapy for CAP patients if the patient is at low risk for TB.</p><br/><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhin.2011.02.010\" target=\"_blank\">Pre-emptive contact precautions for intubated patients reduced healthcare-associated meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus transmission and infection in an intensive care unit</a><p>Summary Healthcare-associated infection by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is still a great concern in an intensive care unit (ICU). Our surveillance data in the ICU revealed that intubated patients were at eight times higher risk of acquiring MRSA than non-intubated patients, so we hypothesised that pre-emptive contact precautions for all intubated patients would prevent healthcare-associated infection by MRSA in the ICU. Patients staying in our ICU for >2 days were included in this study. The study period was divided into two periods. During 2004 (1st period), contact precautions were performed only for patients with MRSA. During 2005–2007 (2nd period), contact precautions were applied to all intubated patients regardless of MRSA infection status. Patients were defined as MRSA-positive on admission when MRSA was detected by surveillance or clinical culture on enrolment. Other MRSA-positive results were defined as healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) transmission. HA-MRSA infection was diagnosed according to the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance Manual. The 1st period comprised 415 patients, and the 2nd period comprised 1280 patients. In intubated patients, HA-MRSA infection rate decreased significantly in the 2nd period (1st period 12.2%, 2nd period 5.6%; P =0.015). HA-MRSA infection of all patients decreased from 3.6 to 2.3 incidents per 1000 patient-days (P <0.05), despite a significant increase in the rate of patients MRSA positive on admission in the 2nd period (1st period 2.9%; 2nd period 6.1%). Pre-emptive contact precautions for intubated patients would be helpful in reducing HA-MRSA infection in ICU.</p>"

Also, these infections may be more severe in immunocompromised patients than in the general population. Early diagnosis and treatment of viral infections continue to be of paramount importance in immunocompromised patients; because once viral replication and invasive infections are evident, prognosis can be grave. Areas covered: The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the main antiviral agents used for the treatment of respiratory viral infections in immunocompromised patients and review of the new agents in the pipeline. Expert commentary: Over the past decade, important diagnostic advances, specifically, the use of rapid molecular testing has helped close the gap between clinical scenarios and pathogen identification and enhanced early diagnosis of viral infections and understanding of the role of prolonged shedding and viral loads. Advancements in novel antiviral therapeutics with high resistance thresholds and effective immunization for preventable infections in immunocompromised patients are needed.</p><br/><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6153324/\" target=\"_blank\">Viral Sepsis in Children</a><p>Sepsis in children is typically presumed to be bacterial in origin until proven otherwise, but frequently bacterial cultures ultimately return negative. Although viruses may be important causative agents of culture-negative sepsis worldwide, the incidence, disease burden and mortality of viral-induced sepsis is poorly elucidated. Consideration of viral sepsis is critical as its recognition carries implications on appropriate use of antibacterial agents, infection control measures, and, in some cases, specific, time-sensitive antiviral therapies. This review outlines our current understanding of viral sepsis in children and addresses its epidemiology and pathophysiology, including pathogen-host interaction during active infection. Clinical manifestation, diagnostic testing, and management options unique to viral infections will be outlined.</p><br/><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6299032/\" target=\"_blank\">Respiratory Viral Infections in Patients With Cancer or Undergoing Hematopoietic Cell Transplant</a><p>Survival rates for pediatric cancer have steadily improved over time but it remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among children. Infections are a major complication of cancer and its treatment. Community acquired respiratory viral infections (CRV) in these patients increase morbidity, mortality and can lead to delay in chemotherapy. These are the result of infections with a heterogeneous group of viruses including RNA viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (IV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), metapneumovirus (HMPV), rhinovirus (RhV), and coronavirus (CoV). These infections maintain a similar seasonal pattern to those of immunocompetent patients. Clinical manifestations vary significantly depending on the type of virus and the type and degree of immunosuppression, ranging from asymptomatic or mild disease to rapidly progressive fatal pneumonia Infections in this population are characterized by a high rate of progression from upper to lower respiratory tract infection and prolonged viral shedding. Use of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy are risk factors for severe disease. The clinical course is often difficult to predict, and clinical signs are unreliable. Accurate prognostic viral and immune markers, which have become part of the standard of care for systemic viral infections, are currently lacking; and management of CRV infections remains controversial. Defining effective prophylactic and therapeutic strategies is challenging, especially considering, the spectrum of immunocompromised patients, the variety of respiratory viruses, and the presence of other opportunistic infections and medical problems. Prevention remains one of the most important strategies against these viruses. Early diagnosis, supportive care and antivirals at an early stage, when available and indicated, have proven beneficial. However, with the exception of neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza infection, there are no accepted treatments. In high-risk patients, pre-emptive treatment with antivirals for upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) to decrease progression to LRTI is a common strategy.

Since first identified in 1989, HCV has been estimated to infect 170 million people worldwide. Mostly chronic hepatitis C virus has a uniform natural history, from liver cirrhosis to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The current therapy for HCV infection consists of a combination of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin. On the other hand, HCV-related liver disease is also the leading indication for liver transplantation. However, posttransplant HCV re-infection of the graft has been reported to be universal. Furthermore, the graft after HCV re-infection often results in accelerated progression to liver failure. In addition, treatment of recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation is often compromised by enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy of interferon-based therapies. Taken together, poor outcome after HCV re-infection, regardless of grafts or recipients, poses a major issue for the hepatologists and transplant surgeons. The aim of this paper is to review several specific aspects regarding HCV re-infection after transplant: risk factors, current therapeutics for HCV in different stages of liver transplantation, cellular function of HCV proteins, and molecular mechanisms of HCV entry. Hopefully, this paper will inspire new strategies and novel inhibitors against recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation and greatly improve its overall outcome.</p>"

To meet these requirements, vaccine studies need to provide a comprehensive understanding of (i) the protective roles of antiviral B and T-cell-mediated immune responses, (ii) the complexity and plasticity of major viral antigens, and (iii) virus molecular biology and pathogenesis. There are many types of vaccines including subunit vaccines, whole-inactivated virus, vectored, and live-attenuated virus vaccines, each of which featuring specific advantages and limitations. While nonliving virus vaccines have clear advantages in being safe and stable, they may cause side effects and be less efficacious compared to live-attenuated virus vaccines. In most cases, the latter induce long-lasting immunity but they may require special safety measures to prevent reversion to highly virulent viruses following vaccination. The chapter summarizes the recent progress in the development of coronavirus (CoV) vaccines, focusing on two zoonotic CoVs, the severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), and the Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV, both of which cause deadly disease and epidemics in humans. The development of attenuated virus vaccines to combat infections caused by highly pathogenic CoVs was largely based on the identification and characterization of viral virulence proteins that, for example, interfere with the innate and adaptive immune response or are involved in interactions with specific cell types, such as macrophages, dendritic and epithelial cells, and T lymphocytes, thereby modulating antiviral host responses and viral pathogenesis and potentially resulting in deleterious side effects following vaccination.</p><br/><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1087510/\" target=\"_blank\">Molecular advances in the cell biology of SARS-CoV and current disease prevention strategies</a><p>In the aftermath of the SARS epidemic, there has been significant progress in understanding the molecular and cell biology of SARS-CoV. Some of the milestones are the availability of viral genome sequence, identification of the viral receptor, development of an infectious cDNA clone, and the identification of viral antigens that elicit neutralizing antibodies. However, there is still a large gap in our understanding of how SARS-CoV interacts with the host cell and the rapidly changing viral genome adds another variable to this equation. Now the SARS-CoV story has entered a new phase, a search for preventive strategies and a cure for the disease. This review highlights the progress made in identifying molecular aspects of SARS-CoV biology that is relevant in developing disease prevention strategies. Authors conclude that development of successful SARS-CoV vaccines and antivirals depends on the progress we make in these areas in the immediate future.</p><br/><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3019510/\" target=\"_blank\">Investigation of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE) of SARS coronavirus infection and its role in pathogenesis of SARS</a><p>Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a mechanism by which viruses, such as dengue, HIV and Ebola, gain entry into some target cells through the use of host antiviral humoral immune responses [1] . Here, we studied the ability of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2] to use ADE mechanisms to enhance its infectivity towards cells of the hematopoietic lineage.\n",
       "We found that heat-inactivated immune serum from rodents vaccinated with recombinant native full-length Spike protein trimers [3] triggered infection of human immune cells (monocytic and B cell lines) by SARS-CoV Spike pseudotyped particle (SARS-CoVpp). The occurrence of antibody-mediated infection of human Raji B cells was further investigated by using live SARS-CoV. Similarly to results obtained with the SARS-CoVpp, only anti-SARS-CoV Spike serum, but not mock immuneserum, induced a massive increase of SARS-CoV viral genes (ORF1b and Nucleocapsid) and viral proteins (Membrane and Nucleocapsid) in Raji B cells. As revealed by immunostaining, only a relatively low, however significant percentage of the Raji cells get infected by antibody-mediated infection and did not allow direct assessment of productive replication by conventional cytopathic assays and TCID50 titration.\n",
       "Taken together, our data suggested that SARS-CoV is able to enter human immune cells via an antibodymediated pathway and immunological consequences of such infection are under investigation (productive replication, cytokines secretion profile and cell death etc). Our data raise reasonable concerns regarding the use of SARS-CoV vaccine in humans and pave the way to further studies focusing on the role of immune-mediated infection phenomenon during SARS pathogenesis.

We discuss which strategies have been assessed immunologically and which have been evaluated in SARS coronavirus challenge models. We discuss inactivated vaccines, virally and bacterially vectored vaccines, recombinant protein and DNA vaccines, as well as the use of attenuated vaccines. Data regarding the correlates of protection, animal models and the available evidence regarding potential vaccine enhancement of SARS disease are discussed. While there is much evidence that various vaccine strategies against SARS are safe and immunogenic, vaccinated animals still display significant disease upon challenge. Current data suggest that intranasal vaccination may be crucial and that new or combination strategies may be required for good protective efficacy against SARS in humans.</p><br/><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.aivir.2016.07.001\" target=\"_blank\">Chapter Five Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara History, Value in Basic Research, and Current Perspectives for Vaccine Development</a><p>Abstract Safety tested Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) is licensed as third-generation vaccine against smallpox and serves as a potent vector system for development of new candidate vaccines against infectious diseases and cancer. Historically, MVA was developed by serial tissue culture passage in primary chicken cells of vaccinia virus strain Ankara, and clinically used to avoid the undesirable side effects of conventional smallpox vaccination. Adapted to growth in avian cells MVA lost the ability to replicate in mammalian hosts and lacks many of the genes orthopoxviruses use to conquer their host (cell) environment. As a biologically well-characterized mutant virus, MVA facilitates fundamental research to elucidate the functions of poxvirus host-interaction factors. As extremely safe viral vectors MVA vaccines have been found immunogenic and protective in various preclinical infection models. Multiple recombinant MVA currently undergo clinical testing for vaccination against human immunodeficiency viruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Plasmodium falciparum. The versatility of the MVA vector vaccine platform is readily demonstrated by the swift development of experimental vaccines for immunization against emerging infections such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Recent advances include promising results from the clinical testing of recombinant MVA-producing antigens of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 or Ebola virus. This review summarizes our current knowledge about MVA as a unique strain of vaccinia virus, and discusses the prospects of exploiting this virus as research tool in poxvirus biology or as safe viral vector vaccine to challenge existing and future bottlenecks in vaccinology.</p>"

Eventually, six main categories of susceptibility gene can be predicted: genes which determine susceptibility to the process of inflammation across a range of disorders-the autoimmune genes; those which determine the specificity of that process for the development of multiple sclerosis-the ubiquitous genes; those which are relevant for the pathogenesis in isolated populations-the domestic genes; those which determine particular phenotypes-the pleotropic genes; those which determine variations in the clinical course-the modifying genes; and those which cluster to provide specifically different (heterogenous) contributions to the pathogenesis-the epistatic genes.\\nHolmdahl Medical Inflammation Research, Lund University, Lund, Sweden Inbred animals are useful for studies of the identification of genes associated with complex diseases like MS.\\nThus, IL-23 plays an important role in the development and expansion of an alternative T cell subset-distinct from the classical Th1-and Th2-type responses, that are critical for the pathogenesis of CNS autoimmune inflammation.\\nDeposits of Abeta are associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and activated microglial cells and astrocytes, and Abeta induces the production of the same cytokines in cultured microglia and astrocytes.\\nData suggest that cytokines may either promote or protect against neuronal degeneration, depending upon the cell type and signaling pathway(s) they activate.\\nStudies of transgenic mice and cultured neural cells that express mutant forms of amyloid precursor protein and presenilin-1 that cause inherited forms of AD have shown that the mutations result in enhanced production of TNF, IL-1beta and IL-6 in response to immune challenge.\\nWe developed an infection-induced molecular mimicry model of CNS autoimmune disease induction by engineering a non-pathogenic variant of Theiler\\'s virus (TMEV) to encode a 30-39mer peptides encompassing the immunodominant myelin PLP139-151 epitope or epitope mimics.\\nDisease and PLP139-151-specific cross-reactive responses could also be induced by infection with a virus engineered to express a 39-mer peptide encompassing the HI574-586 mimic epitope (HI39-TMEV) indicating that the mimic peptide is a natural mimic epitope capable of being processed from its flanking residues.\\nHowever, mice immunized multiple times with the core HI574-586 core peptide in complete Freund\\'s adjuvant (CFA) exhibited no clinical disease symptoms due to failure to secrete high levels of IFN-gamma in response to in vitro re-challenge with PLP139-151 indicating the importance of virus-induced innate immune signals in triggering autoimmune disease via molecular mimicry.\\nvon Herrath La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, San Diego, USA Intuitively one tends to associate viral infections that frequently induce profound inflammation in multiple organs with enhancement of autoimmune processes and diseases such as type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis.\\nWe found that MHV-JHM neurovirulence was marked by diminished expression of IFNgamma mRNA and recruitment of CD8 T cells into the CNS concomitant with heightened MIP-1 transcript levels and greater macrophage infiltration relative to MHV-A59 infection.\\nLong-term cultures of primary neural stem cells derived from human fetal brain were differentiated and studied for their susceptibility to infection by HHV-6 and subsequent complement-mediated damage.\\nTreatment of neural cells with purified HHV-6 virions or anti-CD46 antibodies followed by exposure to human complement resulted in a massive deposition of opsonic C3 fragments, as detected by confocal microscopy, and widespread cell death.\\nThis process has been extensively studied using the animal model experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is induced by immunization with myelin antigen in complete Freund\\'s adjuvant.\\nTo pursue these studies, our laboratory generated T cell receptor transgenic models of CD4+ T cell responses to different epitopes of myelin basic protein (MBP).\\nReddy Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA Using Class II PLP 139-151/IAs tetramers, we have determined the frequency of PLP 139-151 reactive T cells in the naRve repertoire of the SJL mice.\\nMartin Neuroimmunology Branch, NINDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA MS is considered a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease with central nervous system (CNS) inflammation, demyelination and varying degrees of axonal damage.\\nWhile the effector mechanisms of CNS damage include antibodies, complement, cytokines, CD8+ T cell lysis and others as well as factors intrinsic to CNS tissue, e.g., vulnerability to insult, most evidence indicates that CD4+ T cells induce and perpetuate of the disease.\\nWe have recently addressed two questions related to the biological role of autoreactive CD4+ T cells in MS: (1) do the specificity and function of high avidity myelin-specific T cells in MS differ from controls, and is there a correlation between specificity and clinical phenotype?\\nSeveral studies indicate that the inflammatory response associated with demyelination is critical for triggering a sequence of events involving cross-talk between inflammatory cells and reactive astrocytes that lead to the creation of a pro-remyelination environment.\\nIn acute experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), Th2/3 cell-derived signals may not only downregulate the immune response but also induce central nervous system (CNS) repair.\\nGene microarray analysis and functional studies show that (i) TGF-beta-1-2-3 and also interferon (IFN)-beta, a cytokine used to treat multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, induce HGF secretion by microglia and (ii) antibodies to the HGF receptor cMET abrogate OPC chemotaxis induced by TGF-beta-2-treated microglia.\\nTo analyze the molecular mechanisms involved at the muscular target site, we studied the expression of selected genes by quantitative PCR, in muscle biopsies from MG patients.\\nAntibody levels correlate with severity of clinical symptoms, and the sera from some patients inhibit binding of agonist to the ganglionic receptor in vitro.\\nLinington Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK There is increasing evidence that antibody-dependent mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of demyelination in multiple sclerosis, but the identity of the antigens targeted by this pathogenic response remains uncertain.\\nThese results will be discussed with respect to the relevance of MOG as a target for antibody mediated demyelination in human disease, and the use of animal models and proteomic/bioinformatic-based methodologies to identify pathophysiologically relevant autoantibody responses to novel autoantigens of low physical abundance in MS.\\nWillison University of Glasgow, Glasgow, Scotland Progress in our understanding of the Guillain-Barré syndromes has been greatly accelerated by the identification of humoral responses to glycolipids in a significant proportion of cases, and the identification of molecular mimicry with preceding infections as a key mechanism of disease induction.\\nYuki Department of Neurology, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Tochigi, Osaka, Japan Molecular mimicry between microbial and self components is postulated as the mechanism that accounts for the antigen and tissue specificity of immune responses in post-infectious autoimmune diseases.\\nZhu Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barré syndrome, GBS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) are prototypes of T cell mediated autoimmune diseases affecting the peripheral nervous system (PNS).\\nPerivascular accumulation of T lymphocytes and macrophages in the PNS, and high levels systemically of PNS myelin antigen-reactive T cells are characteristic features of both diseases, thereby suggesting a pathogenic role for specific T cell and immunoregulatory cytokines.\\nIn recent years, DC were identified in the inflamed central nervous system (CNS), but their role in the initiation or regulation of the tissue specific immune response is unknown.\\nWe report that DC isolated from mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) exhibit a maturational phenotype similar to immature bone marrow-derived DC or splenic DC as characterized by intermediate surface MHC class II and low expression of the costimulatory molecule CD80.\\nGene targeting of CD200 resulted in enhanced macrophage and microglial activation in situ, suggesting that CD200 may be a ligand that normally engages an inhibitory receptor on myeloid cells.\\nFresh insights into the role of CD200R in regulating microglial cell function will be described as will data from gene expression profiling of adult microglial cells and other brain macrophages.\\nThese studies have revealed a number of molecules, but especially certain activating receptors that characterize a unique molecular fingerprint for microglial cells within the adult CNS.\\nPrimary murine microglial cells stimulated with M-CSF-induced transcription of genes involved in tissue organization and remodeling, maintenance and regulation of brain homeostasis.\\nNon-neuronal cells in ALS neurodegeneration: mechanisms and therapies J.D. Rothstein Johns Hopkins University, Department of Neurology, Baltimore, MD, USA Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is an adult onset neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically by muscle wasting and weakness.\\nHowever, recent studies have strongly suggested that disease progression and death of motor neurons depends upon participation of non-neuronal cells including focal inflammatory responses and dysfunction of astroglia.\\nThe clinical trial of this vaccination therapy in AD patients was halted because of acute meningoencephalitis as a side effect, which was thought to be induced by CD4+ T cells reactive to A-beta.\\nGlutamate: we discovered for the first time that normal, cancer and autoimmune encephalitogenic Tcells, alike neurons and glia cells, express high levels of ion-channel (ionotropic) glutamate-receptors.\\nDopamine: We discovered for the first time that normal human T-cells express on their outer membranes functional dopamine receptors of the D3 and D2 subtypes, and that dopamine (~10 nM) or selective dopaminereceptor agonists trigger various T-cells functions among them: (1) differential cytokine-secretion of either inflammatory (TNFalpha) or anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines, different from the robust nonselective cytokine-secretion btriggered by classicalQ TCR-activation, (2) integrin-mediated adhesion to extracellular glycoproteins, (3) unique denovo gene-expression.\\nThe ability of glutamate and dopamine on their own to trigger T-cell functions and gene-expression could be of substantial scientific and clinical importance for numerous conditions in health and disease, among them: (a) transmigration of bgoodQ T-cells into the brain for different patrolling/protecting tasks, (b) Detrimental activation and maintenance of bbadQ T-cells in the CNS, e.g., in multiple-sclerosis.\\nThymic neuroendocrine precursors engage two types of interactions with pre-T cells either as ligands that bind with high affinity to neuroendocrine receptors expressed by thymocytes, or after processing as self-antigens presented by the thymic MHC machinery.\\nPrevention of NF-kappaB activation by intracerebroventricular administration of a NEMO-binding domain peptide that selectively inhibits the IKKgamma/IKKbeta interaction abrogated sickness behavior induced by intraperitoneal but not by intracerebroventricular injection of IL-1, confirming the predominant role of IL-1 receptors at the blood-brain interface in the neural transduction of the peripheral immune message.\\nDhabhar Health Sciences Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA Cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses exert important immunoprotective (resistance to infectious agents) or immunopathological (allergic or autoimmune hypersensitivity) effects.\\nCompared with controls, CMI sites from acutely stressed animals show significantly greater erythema and induration, numbers of infiltrating leukocytes, and levels of cytokine gene and protein expression.\\nThese results suggest that during acute stress, endogenous stress hormones enhance skin immunity by increasing leukocyte trafficking and cytokine gene expression at the site of antigen entry.\\nThe main effector substances of the systemic inflammatory response are inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFalpha, IL-1 and IL-6, chemokines,, and other mediators of inflammation; the acute phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), cell adhesion molecules, fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; the effectors of the sensory afferent system, such as substance P; and, of the stress system, namely hypothalamic CRH and vasopressin, cortisol, norepinephrine and epinephrine, and peripheral neuronal CRH.\\nThe pathways mediating the proinflammatory responses of CRH were studied and demonstrated specific CRH-mediated induction of the NFÀkB DNA binding activity in immune cells.\\nMethods: Using a 1258 cDNA microarray, a comprehensive gene expression profile of T cells of 72 MS patients (65 RR and 7 SP) with various MRI lesion distributions before and after IFN-beta treatment was compared with that of 22 age-and sexmatched healthy subjects.\\nResults: Hierarchical cluster analysis of 286 genes expressed differentially between IFN-untreated MS patients and controls as a discriminator identified four distinct subgroups of MS designated A, B, C, and D, among which the subgroup A showed the expression pattern most similar to the control group.\\nConclusions: These results indicate that microarray analysis of the gene expression profile of T cells could classify a heterogenous population of MS into four molecularly distinct subgroups closely associated with the disease activity, lesion distribution, and therapeutic response to IFN-beta.\\nOur results provide a new model for environmental effects in MS, and may help explain the fact that although linkage to HLA is the most consistent finding in MS genetics studies, the HLA-linked MS susceptibility locus may be influenced by the effects of age, season, or other non-Mendelian genetic factors.\\nAnalysis of the expression of CIITA and the CIITA-induced invariant chain in spinal cord tissue revealed lower levels of both transcripts in PVG.1AV1 rats compared to DA, both under normal conditions and after VRA.\\nIbrahim a a Institute of Immunology, University of Rostock, Rostock, Germany;

b Brain Research Institute, Vienna Medical University, Vienna, Vienna CD14 is a membrane receptor expressed on cells of the monocyte lineage known to be an essential mediator in innate host defense and in the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.\\nThe aim of our study was to investigate a possible association of the -260 C-T promoter polymorphism in the CD14 gene with the susceptibility and disease severity in 225 patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS).\\nThis is the first study to describe an association of the -260 C-T polymorphism within the promoter region of the CD14 gene, a receptor of the innate immune system, with the longterm disease severity in MS patients.\\nNo differences in the distribution of A561C between patients and controls were shown, but patients bearing the wild-type allele had an increased probability to develop the disease after the age of 40 years.\\nThis observation was complemented by expression analyses of the receptors on peripheral mononuclear cells, which did not demonstrate differential expression between MS patients and controls.\\nTo analyze the genetic susceptibility to MG, polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay was applied to screen single nucleotide polymorphisms at À3575(T/A) and À2763(C/A) positions of the IL-10 promoter and at +16974 (A/C) 3V UTR of the IL-12p40 genes in 106 patients and 152 healthy controls (HC).\\nA polymorphism in the cytotoxic Tlymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA4) gene has been reported to alter T cell activation and confirm genetic susceptibility to several autoimmune diseases including MG.\\nWe demonstrate that the large majority of foamy macrophages in postmortem MS brain express markers characteristic for anti-inflammatory alternatively activated macrophages (aamf), including IL-1ra, CCL18 and CD163, and produce the antiinflammatory molecules IL-10 and TGF-beta.\\nThe surface unit of MSRV (multiple sclerosis associated retroviral element) envelope protein induces an immune bias in patients with MS that correlates with disease activity A.\\nThe presence of MSRV, a retroviral element defining a novel family of human endogenous retroviruses (HERV-W) has now been confirmed in serum and cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and a correlation between circulating MSRV virion load and MS evolution has been demonstrated.\\nIn an attempt to link the potential effects of MSRV with MS disease, the pro-inflammatory properties of the surface unit of MSRV envelope protein were evaluated in PBMC of MS patients and compared with healthy controls.\\nWesemann University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama, USA Inflammatory events in the Central Nervous System (CNS) contribute to the pathology underlying diseases such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\\'s disease and HIV-1-associated dementia, and activated macrophages/ microglia are central to this response.\\nMoreover, an increase in IFN-gamma-mediated STAT-1alpha DNA binding activity, nuclear presence and transcriptional potential is observed in the TRADD bknock-downQ cells.\\nRecent studies have shown that the TLR4 ligand LPS signals independently of MyD88 resulting in the activation of interferon regulatory factor-3 (IRF-3), a transcription factor required for induction of primary anti-viral response genes such as type 1 interferons and the chemokines RANTES/CCL5 and IP-10/ CXCL10.\\nConsidering the apparent similarities between IL-1 and TLR4 signaling, we hypothesized that IL-1 is also capable of activating IRF-3 in human primary astrocytes and that this activation would result in the expression of IRF-3-dependent type I interferons necessary for innate antiviral immunity.\\nThese data are the first to show that IL-1, in addition to TLR\\'s, can stimulate IRF3 in human primary astrocytes, implicating this cytokine as an activator of genes involved in innate antiviral responses.\\nThe activation of glial cells is believed to be an early event in the development of AD, and both IL-1beta and interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been detected early in AD brains, suggesting that these cytokines may play an important role in the development of AD.\\nIn this study, the effects mediated by IL-1beta and the Abeta (1-42) and Abeta (25-35) peptides on NFkappaB binding activity and cytokine expression in rat primary mixed glial cell cultures were examined.\\nChemokine secretion and chemokine receptor expression in brain cell aggregate cultures treated with interferon-gamma F.A.

Loughlin The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK A 3-dimensional brain cell aggregate culture system, which approximates to the brain in vivo in terms of glial and neuronal development and cell-cell interactions, was used as a model of the CNS parenchyma in vitro.\\nThese results suggest that the nature and extent of the inflammatory response in the CNS cannot be predicted from studies of isolated cell populations, but critically depends on interactions between cells and a complex milieu of secreted mediators.\\nOur approach complements existing in vivo and in vitro studies and allows us to assess the effect of inflammatory mediators on cells within a complex CNS environment.\\nPitossi a a Gene Therapy Laboratory, Institute for Biochemical Research, Buenos Aires, Argentina; b CNS Inflammation Group, University of Southamptom, Southampton, UK; c Molecular Neuropathology, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK Interleukin-1beta (IL-1) has been implicated in the pathology of several chronic neurodegenerative diseases including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\\'s disease and prion disease.\\nIn summary, our data show that chronic expression of IL-1, in contrast to its acute delivery, can reversibly damage CNS integrity and implicates this cytokine or downstream components as major mediators of demyelination in chronic inflammatory and demyelinating diseases.\\nSCI is induced in CD-1 mice using a clip compression model and the temporal expression patterns of several cytokines, chemokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are determined using RNase Protection Assays and real-time PCR.\\n108 Alphaviral expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 inhibits autoimmune encephalomyelitis in mice M.J.V. Vähä-Koskela, J.C. Holmlund and A.E. Hinkkanen Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacy, Åbo Akademi University, Turku, Finland Introduction: Current treatment strategies for chronic, inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are almost solely based on down-regulation of the immune system by systemically administered drugs.\\nIt is involved in the generation and regulation of a normal immune response from monocyte activation to memory CD8+ T cell development.\\nWe included investigation of function of expressed receptors, intracellular signaling pathways, cytokines and other soluble mediators released after activation of cells using a panel of stimuli embracing many activation routes.\\nThe resultant phenotype representing autoimmune-susceptible DA rat MQ is lower TNF, IL-6, IL-1beta, p35 and NO production with an associated high arginase activity and high expression of p19.\\nIn the present study, we analyzed the sequential mRNA expression pattern of IL-23 in sciatic nerves from Lewis rats with myelin-induced experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), a classical animal model of the Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), using a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR.\\nThus, our present data suggest that IL-23, primarily expressed by macrophages, plays an important role during the early phase of EAN and therefore appears to be critically involved in the initiation rather than perpetuation of an immune response in immune-mediated inflammation of the peripheral nerve.\\nThe aim of study was to evaluate changes in mRNA expression in peripheral blood cells (PBC), and in serum concentration of anti-inflammatory cytokine: interleukin-10 (IL-10) during the acute phase (first 7 days) of IS.\\nZaremba a a University School of Medicine, Poznan, Poland; b Institute of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, Poznan, Poland Proinflammatory cytokines released during ischaemia by activated brain resident and peripheral blood cells are important mediators of inflammatory response,the process which exacerbates cerebral damage.\\nThe objective of the study was to determine IL-18 levels in sera of 23 ischaemic stroke patients,compare results with the group of 15 controls and study the relation between IL-18 levels and the volume of hemispheric computer tomography hypodense areas representing early ischaemic changes.\\nThe present study confirms that NK immune cells are up regulated for the secretion of inflammatory neurotoxic cytokines in AD.\\nLicinio b , G.P. Chrousos a and P.W. Gold a a National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA; b University of California, Los Angeles, USA In addition to affective, cognitive, and neuroendocrine abnormalities, depressed patients have increased risk of cardiovascular disease and bone loss.\\nThe purpose of this study was to compare the 24-h secretion of IL-6 in nine depressed patients and nine gender-, age-and BMI-matched controls, in an attempt to link changes of this cytokine with the manifestations of major depression (MD).\\nTo assess the role of cytokines and chemokines in SSPE, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples from 60 SSPE patients, 38 patients with neurological infectious or inflammatory diseases (IN) and 27 patients with noninflammatory neurological diseases (NIN) were examined by ELISA for IFN-gamma, IL-10, IL-4 and IL-12 as well as for CXCL8 (IL-8), CXCL10 (IP-10) and CCL2 (MCP-1) levels.\\nThe increased systemic and intrathecal IL-12 secretion without accompanying IFN-gamma induction may implicate an initial immune activation without an effective cellular response in the pathogenesis of SSPE.\\nWe studied cytokine expression patterns in mononuclear cells (MNC) of female untreated MS patients from Sassari, Sardinia, and Stockholm, Sweden, compared to sex-and age-matched healthy controls from both areas.\\nThe object of the study was to identify changes in complement factor C3 concentrations and the degree of C3 activation in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in early multiple sclerosis (MS), i.e., at time for diagnosis of disease.\\nA significant increase of the mean value of activated C3 concentration in CSF of MS patients to that of the control group was observed.\\nThe activated C3 level in serum was not significantly different from that of the control group, and no significant change in concentration of total C3 was obtained in neither CSF nor serum.\\nThe aim of our study was to evaluate whether high dose of methylprednisolone (1000 mg) given for five consecutive days during the disease exacerbations have any impact on immune parameters detected in peripheral blood of MS patients.\\nArbour and J.P. Antel Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montreal, Canada Classical Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling activates antigen presenting cells (APCs) and induces pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion.\\nThe aims of our study were to assess the expression of TLRs on adult human microglia, the resident APCs of the CNS, and to determine whether signaling through TLR3 and TLR4 can stimulate production of IFN-beta and interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10).\\nTo investigate the expression profile of TLRs on microglia and other CNS cell types during viral encephalitis, groups of Balb/c, nu/nu and IFNalpha/betaRÀ/À mice were infected with SFV and tissues sampled at multiple time points.\\nMiller Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA Theiler\\'s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) establishes a persistent central nervous system (CNS) infection in glial cells of susceptible mice, leading to the development of an autoimmune demyelinating disease.\\nBecause of its autoimmune nature and the prominent infiltration of CD4+ T cells and phagocytes into the central nervous system, TMEV-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) is considered a highly relevant animal model for multiple sclerosis.\\nWe have previously shown that innate immune stimulation of astrocytes with Toll-like receptor ligands results in the production of innate immune effector molecules, but not the induction of antigen presenting cell (APC) functions.\\nHere, we have infected astrocytes with TMEV and induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, and type I IFNs. The mechanisms by which astrocytes recognize viral infection is being investigated and preliminary data indicates it is dependent on replicating virus.\\nWe therefore propose a model in which astrocytes are important for early CNS inflammation and recruitment of the peripheral immune cells to the CNS during TMEV infection, but are only capable of contributing to CD4+ T cell activation late in the autoimmune phase of disease.\\nTo specifically implicate an antiviral role of IFN-gamma-mediated signaling in oligodendrocytes, novel transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative IFN-gamma receptor 1 chain (dnIFN-gammaR1) under control of the proteolipid protein promoter were derived.\\nN-specific immune priming of wild-type mice by a prime-boost protocol conferred CD8 T cell-dependent protection against BDV infection and disease.\\nWe further observed that more than 70% of brains from infected GKO but not from wild-type mice showed T cell-dependent severe neuronal damage in the hippocampus, suggesting a neuroprotective role of interferon gamma in BDV-induced meningoencephalitis.\\nIn conclusion, BDV-specific CD8 T cells require interferon-gamma for mediating antiviral defence but not for inducing neurological disease, suggesting that two distinct effector mechanisms are at work.\\nUsing the Staphylococcus aureus-induced brain abscess model established in our laboratory, we have sought to define the functional importance of IL-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in the host anti-bacterial immune response using cytokine gene knockout (KO) mice.\\nThe results demonstrate that although they share many redundant activities, IL-1 and TNF-alpha are important for containing bacterial infection in evolving brain abscesses as evident by increased mortality and bacterial burdens in IL-1 and TNF-alpha KO mice compared to wild type (WT) animals.\\nThese results indicate that IL-1 and TNF-alpha play a pivotal role during the acute stage of brain abscess development through regulating the ensuing antibacterial inflammatory response.\\nSchlqter b a University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; b University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany CNS infections can be controlled effectively by cells of the immune system, but organ specific cells such as astrocytes play an important part in the host response as well.\\nThe functional role of astrocytes exerted via their intermediate protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in CNS infections was studied in murine Staphylococcus aureus-induced brain abscess.\\nCompared to wild type (WT) mice, GFAP0/0 mice developed larger and poorly demarcated inflammatory lesions, paralleled by a significantly increased intracerebral bacterial load, a diffuse leukocytic infiltration even of the contralateral hemisphere, purulent ventriculitis, vasculitis, and severe brain edema.\\nThese data were paralleled by observations in the model of Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE), during which the intracerebral parasitic load was significantly increased with tachyzoite-induced tissue necrosis in the brains of GFAP0/0 mice in chronic TE.\\nVirus specific antibody secreting cells (ASC) within the CNS increased prominently between 15 and 21 days p.i. and were maintained at high frequencies during persistence; by contrast, only low frequencies were detectable in bone marrow.\\nFlow cytometric analysis of infiltrates isolated from the infected CNS indicated a gradual increase in CD19+ B cells by day 15 p.i. Delayed plasmablast recruitment was reflected by emergence of syndecan positive cells only between days 10 and 14 p.i. While the relative percentage of syndecan positive cells remained constant after day 21, ongoing differentiation was suggested by an increasing loss of class II surface expression.\\nEarly viral replication in the brain is accompanied by CNS immune activation including endothelial cell ICAM-1 expression and elevated microglial expression of CD68 and MHC class II.\\nUpregulation of COX (cyclooxygenase)-2 expression and subsequent production of arachadonic metabolites in the brain may be a key pathway regulating CNS immune responses during acute infection.\\nBoth endothelial ICAM-1 expression and parenchymal microglial activation (measured by image analysis of immunostained tissue sections) were elevated in rofecoxib-treated, SIV-infected animals at 10 days post-inoculation as compared to untreated, infected animals, demonstrating that arachadonic acid metabolites such as prostaglandin E2 may down-regulate CNS immune responses.\\nIn parallel with increases in CNS immune activation, CNS viral replication measured by real time RT-PCR was significantly elevated in the basal ganglia of rofecoxib-treated animals versus untreated, infected animals.\\nSince IFN-gamma is an important antiviral cytokine that can modulate lymphocyte function and activation, we examined the brains, spleens and CNS-draining cervical lymph nodes (CLN) of infected mice, examining chemokine mRNA, cellular populations and effector CTL activity.\\nWe studied the mRNA-expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain-derived neuroptrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrphin-3 (NT-3) in an established model of murine Herpes-simplex-Virus encephalitis.\\nMiller Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois, USA Antigen-specific tolerance of CD4+ T-cells induced by the injection of antigen coupled, ECDI-fixed cells into recipient mice is a procedure that has been pursued as a possible therapy for autoimmune diseases, as it prevents and/or ameliorates several CD4+ T-cell mediated diseases in mice.\\nKang Min Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, USA Theiler\\'s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection in the CNS induces a demyelinating disease similar to human multiple sclerosis.\\nTo delineate the early events in the virally induced demyelinating disease, chemokine and cytokine gene activation upon viral infection in glial cells was examined.\\nThese results demonstrate that infection of astrocytes and other glial cells by TMEV induces early NF-kappaB-mediated cytokine/chemokine gene activation involved in CNS inflammatory responses leading to demyelination.\\nFurther studies are being undertaken to address the role of NF-kappaB subunits and upstream signals involved in the cellular activation and pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease.\\nOhara a a Kanazawa Medical University, Ishikawa, Japan; b Sendai City Hospital, Sendai, Japan DA strain and other members of the TO subgroup strains of Theiler\\'s murine encephalomyelitis virus cause a biphasic disease characterized by acute self-limiting gray matter inflammation followed by chronic inflammatory demyelination in the spinal cord in susceptible strains of mice.\\nThe present study investigated the effects of neonatal stress on susceptibility to a virally mediated animal model of multiple sclerosis, Theiler\\'s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection.\\nResults: Treatment groups were similar in terms of age, sex, and duration of disease while stage at diagnosis differed: no Stage 1 patients were in the h-IFN1a 3/ wkSC group ( pb0.02).\\nTo investigate antigen-specific T cell responses in SSPE, we analyzed proliferation and cytokine secretion from 37 SSPE patients and 45 healthy controls (HC) to specific antigens and to measles vaccine (MV).\\nWe recently detected enriched transcripts for several immune factors in cultured neonatal OECs by microarray analysis, including lysozyme (Lyz), the chemokines growth-regulated oncogene (Gro, CXCL1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1, CCL2), and the interleukin 6-responsive transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPb).\\nAlthough the phagocytic activity of peritoneal macrophages or the two murine macrophage cell lines was not significantly affected by COAM, the increased number of PMNs in the peritoneum was responsible for the enhanced phagocytic efficiency and the accumulation of proteolytic enzymes.\\nSince nothing is known on the ability of DC to migrate to the CNS during prion diseases, we investigated the immunohistochemical localization of CD205+ DC in the brain of C57BL/6 mice intraperitoneally infected with the mouse-adapted KFu strain of Gerstmann-Str7ussler-Scheinker syndrome, a human genetic prion disorder.\\nThese findings demonstrate that myeloid DC can enter the CNS of prion infected mice, suggesting a possible role for these cells in the pathogenesis of prion disorders.\\nOur results suggest that gram-negative LPS induces an acute immunological response mediated by soluble factors, which are capable, when penetrating the BNB to cause transient baxonal stunningQ and functionally affect neural conduction.\\nSeveral lines of evidence indicate that SCs display immune-related functions, such as the expression of MHC class II antigens, suggesting that SCs can acquire the role of a facultative antigen presenting cell.\\nTo elucidate mechanisms of innate immune responses in human muscle, we investigated the expression of TLR1-9 mRNA in cultured human myoblasts and TE671 rhabdomyosarcoma cells using QRT-PCR.\\nBecher University Hospital of Zurich, Neuroimmunology Center, Zurich, Switzerland TH1 lymphocytes were thought to play a central role in the initiation and potentially in the propagation of multiple sclerosis and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).\\nFor gene delivery in vivo, we use recombinant lentiviral vectors infecting mouse embryos to generate transgenic mice constitutively expressing the siRNA of the target gene or to infect MOG-reactive T cell lines prior to adoptive transfer into naive recipient mice.\\nTransfection of naive MBP-specific T cells with AS-Tbet or siRNA-Tbet prior to differentiation resulted in decreased IFN-gamma production and a dramatic reduction in the ability of these cells to transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) to naive recipient mice.\\nAxonal loss and demyelination were reduced in the CNS of mice that received CD200Fc. In treated animals, there was increased production of IL-4 by primed splenocytes in vitro after re-stimulation with MOG peptide.\\nHowever, recent observations suggest that both allergic and autoimmune mechanisms are involved in the development of EAE, and pharmacological blockade of histamine, one the main mediator of allergic responses in mice and in humans, might prevent EAE.\\nGenetic and pharmacological studies have shown that histamine H1 and H2 receptors expressed on T-cells and antigens presenting cells play an important role in regulating T-effector cell functions leading to autoimmune inflammatory responses within the CNS.\\nHere, we show that despite having identical T-cell effector responses, C57BL/6J mice with a disrupted histamine H3 receptor (H3RKO) immunized with MOG35-55 for the induction of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis develop earlier, more severe clinical signs during the acute phase of the disease compared to wild-type controls.\\nFailure of H3RKO mice to limit the acute phase of the autoimmune inflammatory response and clinical disease is consistent with inhibition of negative regulation of presynaptic autoregulatory function in maintaining tissue barrier permeability.\\nAdditionally, genetic complementation studies indicate that a structural polymorphism within the third intracellular loop of the H3R may underlie eae8, a previously identified QTL controlling the severity of clinical signs and weight loss, a phenotype known to be regulated by central H3R activity.\\nPro-inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-6) were sharply decreased in MIFÀ/À mice relative to WT controls at all time points, while IL-4 and IL-10 secreting cells were significantly increased in MIFÀ/À mice.\\nAutoreactive T cells persist in rats protected against EAE and can be activated through innate immunity S.B. Conant, N.A. Wolf and R.H. Swanborg Wayne State University, Detroit, USA Lewis rats are rendered unresponsive to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP), or MBP68-86, the dominant encephalitogenic epitope, in incomplete Freund\\'s adjuvant.\\nTGF-beta has been implicated in T regulatory cell (Treg) activity, and since Treg cells frequently express the CD4+CD25+ phenotype, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that Treg cells maintain autoreactive T cells in the anergic state, but these can be released from anergy by products of the innate immune system (e.g., CpG) which override regulatory mechanisms that maintain immune homeostasis.\\nThese results provided evidence that IFN-gamma is not essential for EAE development but plays an important role in down-regulating disease.\\nM. tuberculosis in CFA is responsible for the Gr-1 cell increase in the spleen following immunization, which starts as early as 4 days p.i. and continues until at least 4 weeks p.i. These studies provide a novel way for innate immune cells to regulate adaptive immunity.\\nThis DNA vaccination strategy has allowed us to assess the effects of an NG2-specific antibody response on the modulation of disease severity in adoptive transfer EAE and on remyelination in MOG induced EAE.\\nWhile the exact functional role of this cytokine in neuroinflammation is currently unknown, several studies have documented elevated levels of OSM in the brains of patients with the progressive relapsing-remitting neurological inflammatory disease multiple sclerosis (MS).\\nCell adhesion molecules are of fundamental importance in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and an animal model for MS, the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), by affecting the interaction between target and effector cells.\\nWe report the significant finding that the two MS types have different astrocyte response patterns: (1) in the pre-clinical period, considerable astrocyte hypertrophy occurs in RR-EAE whereas PP-EAE shows a much smaller increase;\\n(3) during remission (RR-EAE), astrocyte hypertrophy remains; (4) astrocyte processes in RR-EAE intercalate between and separate inflammatory cells into small groups whereas inflammatory foci in the PP-EAE are free of astrocyte processes; (5) in RR-EAE astrocyte response is related to disease stage; but to clinical score in PP-EAE.\\nRecently, the protein concentration of SHH has been shown to be upregulated during active disease in a spontaneously demyelinating mouse model and to be decreased in multiple sclerosis (MS) white matter.\\nSpecific object of our study was to investigate the expression pattern of SHHduring lesion evolution in myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model strongly mimicking MS.\\nIn this study, we sought to determine the expression profile of neurotrophic factors in relation to the stage of disease during progression and remission of EAE in order to gain insights into their possible functions.\\nIn the present study, we analyzed expression of three lately described chemokine receptors CCR7, CCR8 and CX3CR1 in the CNS and in peripheral tissues during chronic-relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (ChREAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS).\\nConclusion: Our results suggest that chemokine receptors CCR7, CCR8 and CX3CR1 are involved in pathogenesis of ChREAE and that they may be potential target for treatment of the CNS autoimmune disorders.\\nIn addition, we performed DNA-vaccination with an eukaryotic expression plasmid encoding for TWEAK resulting in a more severe disease course compared to control vaccinated animals.\\nFurther in vitro and ex vivo studies suggest that blockade of Fn14-mediated signalling interferes with the recruitment of immune effector cells into the CNS.\\nTo investigate the potential role of ADAMTSs, white matter from the spinal cord of rats at pre-disease, peak and recovery stages of acute EAE and naive controls were assessed for the expression of ADAMTS-1, -4 and -5, their natural inhibitor, TIMP-3 as well as the ECM components, phosphacan and neurocan, at the mRNA and protein level.\\nIn the present study, we analyzed the expression pattern of all 22 known rat MMPs in a rMOG-EAE model in DA rats during the clinical course using real time RT-PCR.\\nFor this purpose, we induced acute monophasic EAE in the Lewis rat by passive transfer of encephalitogenic MBPspecific T-cells in wild type and in PLP overexpressing transgenic Lewis rats in presence or absence of demyelinating anti-MOG antibodies.\\nWhile many substituted peptides were encephalitogenic suggesting those residues were not critical for ether binding to MHC or activating T cells, others did not induce either disease or proliferation.\\nConclusion: While nonencephalitogenic single amino acid substitutions of MOG 8-21 and PLP 56-70 inhibit relapsing disease in mice immunised with MOG 8-21, the therapy was significantly more effective when the wild-type peptide is used.\\nWe found highly impaired myelinoligodendrocyte-glycoprotein (MOG)35-55-specific T cell activation in vitro and complete resistance to MOG 35-55-induced EAE in T cellspecific IKK2-deficient C57BL/6 mice.\\nOur data suggest an IKK2-dependent threshold for autoantigen-specific T cell activation and underscores the potential value of IKK inhibition for the therapy of autoimmune diseases.\\nTo investigate the influence of MHC genes on manifestation of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease, we studied myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE in H-2 congenic C3H mice.\\nThe role of immune cell subsets, T cell specificities and antibody responses in determining the pathogenesis of disease will be discussed.\\nIn this study, we demonstrated that isolated mononuclear cells from spinal cords (SCMNC) of DA rats in different phases of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are unresponsive to mitogenic stimuli during acute phase but not during relapse of EAE.\\nIn the robust, relapsing Biozzi ABH mouse model of MS, using a combination of a transient-deletion of primed, auto-reactive T cells (by CD4-specific antibodies) followed (1 week later) by intravenous myelin-antigen administration (antigen-coupledsplenocytes), established relapsing disease in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis can be effectively silenced following disease induction.\\nUnfortunately, when treatment was initiated late during chronicrelapsing disease (after three paralytic attacks), despite inhibition of further relapses; mice demonstrated evidence of secondary progression, including increased spasticity and deterioration in mobility.\\nThis suggests that autoimmune therapy in MS should begin as early as possible to have an optimum chance for success and indicates that once sufficient deficit is accumulated, targeting relapsing, immunological components of disease alone is unlikely to be sufficient to control progression based on a clinical outcome.\\nT-box expressed in T cells, or T-bet, is a transcription factor that is believed to play a key role in regulation of the IFN-gamma gene and in the differentiation of pathogenic autoimmune Th1 cells.\\nMotor-evoked potentials (MEP) by transcranial electrical stimulation were studied as an in vivo method for assessing corticospinal system changes in chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), obtained by immunizing C57Bl/6 mice with MOG35-55, in parallel with neuropathology.\\nThus, the small-sized, slowed or even absent MEP observed in the latest EAE stages, in keeping with neuropathological findings, suggests that acute axonal damage and chronic axonal loss are characterizing feature of EAE in C57Bl/6 mice, perhaps as a consequence of early inflammatory/demyelinating events occurring in the first 20 dpi.\\nResults: BMC expressing low or undetectable levels of alpha 4 integrin (VLA-4) were associated with a high potential for T cell-enhanced migration to the CNS, and with the highest diseaseinducing activity, compared to BMC expressing a high level of alpha 4 integrin.\\nThis developmental pathway is enhanced by non-myelin-specific T cells in an acute, pre-pathogenic time frame, and may be responsible for modulating susceptibility to and severity of CNS inflammation in diseases such as multiple sclerosis.\\nThis study identifies the pattern of CCR2 expression on inflammatory infiltrate in a number of CNS disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS), West Nile Encephalomyelitis (WNE), using immunohistochemistry and CCL2 binding assays.\\nIt has been shown to have an important role in inflammation and acts to increase activation of pro-inflammatory leukocytes; increase edema, vasodilation, and adhesion molecule expression on vascular endothelial cell; and is involved in the detection of pain by sensory neurons.\\nWe have investigated the role of the substance P receptor, neurokinin-1 (NK-1), in central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity using the model disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in C57Bl/6 and NK-1 receptor knock out mice treated with a subcutaneous injection of the CNS self-peptide, myelin oligodendroglial protein (MOG).\\nOur data show that the NK-1 receptor is expressed on brain microvessel endothelial cells, and that mice lacking the NK-1 receptor experience a less severe disease in the chronic state.\\nWe investigated the effects of the beta chemokines MCP-1 and MIP-1alpha on monocyte adhesion to human brain microvessel endothelial cells (HBMEC) in an in vitro model of the BBB.\\nExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and is widely studied as an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS).\\nThis BBB transmigration assay provides useful information that promotes our understanding of the biological significance of differential chemokine receptor expression in blood compared to parenchymal CNS lesions.\\nBased on our microarray analyses that showed osteopontin, a potent chemoattractant protein, was upregulated in the brains of simian immunodeficiency virus encephalitis cases, we are currently examining the role of osteopontin in comparison to other chemokines, including fractalkine, in our transendothelial migration model with the hypothesis that osteopontin is involved in the decrease of reverse transmigration.\\nSupernatants of cytokine-stimulated astrocyte cultures were more effective than control cell-free medium and supernatants of unstimulated astrocytes in inducing the migration of monocyte-derived immature DC.\\nTaken together, our data show that microglia of blood origin can cross the BBB, are preferentially recruited to damaged areas of the brain and that they could potentially activate cells of the adaptive immune system.\\nAn increased percentage of cells expressing high levels of CD45 but slightly CD11b was observed in moribund mice.\\nThis population was mainly derived from donor cells in bone marrow chimeric mice and expressed TCR alpha/beta, CD8 alpha and considerable levels of myeloid markers such as CD11b, Gr-1 and 7/4.\\nFurthermore, OPN and MCP-3-attracted cells exhibited distinct characteristics: OPN-induced macrophages expressed higher levels of CD44v6 (OPN receptor), CD16 and CD62L (involved in migration of cells to the brain parenchyma), and lower levels of CD86 (related to type-2 response), and CD14 than MCP-3-elicited cells.\\nThese results indicate protective-like effects of reduced CD26-like expression/enzymatic activity on EAE and emphasise cell migration/adhesion as a contributing mechanism in rats.\\nThe present study investigated the effect of an anti-VLA-4 antibody in a chronic EAE model in the C57Bl/6 mouse.\\nWe reported that (B6ÂSJL) F1 (H-2b/s) mice, with severe relapsing-remitting disease, had extensive infiltration by CD4+ T cells compared to C57BL/6 (B6) (H-2b) mice, which developed mild low-relapsing disease in response to myelin oligodendrocyte peptide 35-55 (MOG35-55).\\nWe previously demonstrated an increase of HO-1 and -2 at mRNA level by quantitative PCR and microarray analysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat brains, a validated model for MS.\\nOur previous studies demonstrated that oligomeric recombinant TCR ligands (RTL) can treat clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and induce long-term T cell tolerance against encephalitogenic peptides.\\nThese results suggest that monomeric RTL therapy induces a cytokine switch that curbs the encephalitogenic potential of PLP-139-151-specific T cells without fully preventing their entry into CNS, wherein they reduce the severity of inflammation.\\nThese results strongly support the clinical application of this novel class of peptide/MHC class II constructs in patients with multiple sclerosis who have focused T cell responses to known encephalitogenic myelin peptides.\\nLuteolin treatment resulted in reduced inflammation and axonal damage in the CNS by preventing monocyte migration across the brain endothelium by modulating the activity of Rho GTPases, signal transducers involved in transendothelial migration.\\nWe evaluated FTY720 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), focusing on total and myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific serum immunoglobulin (Ig) as an indicator for a T helper type 1 or 2 (Th1, Th2)-driven immune response.\\nPeak disease in the vehicle group 2 weeks post-immunization correlated with an increasing titer of MBP-specific IgG, which was lower in FTY720-and almost undetectable in cyclosporin A (CsA)-treated rats.\\nOnce intravenously (i.v.) or intrathecally (i.t.) injected in mice affected by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), syngenic adult neural precursor cells (aNPCs) promote multifocal remyelination and functional recovery by selectively home within inflamed central nervous system (CNS) areas.\\nFinally, in vivo blockage of VLA-4 significantly reduced CNS homing of aNPCs. Our results indicate that aNPCs home specifically to inflamed brain areas during EAE, once i.v. and i.t. injected, owing to the constitutive expression of the same cell adhesion molecules (CAM) and chemokine receptors used by enchephalitogenic lymphocytes to enter the CNS.\\nLF 15-0195, is a novel molecule that inhibits the differentiation of autoantigen-specific CD4 T cells into effector pathogenic lymphocytes and has a potent immunosuppressive effect in several pathological manifestations including EAE.\\nTogether, these data demonstrate that short-term treatment with LF 15-0195, not only prevents EAE in LEW rats, but also, permits the development of an antigen-specific tolerance mediated by regulatory CD4 T cells.\\nTo further explore the protecting role of adult neural precursor cells (aNPCs) in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we have intravenously (i.v.)-injected syngenic aNPCs into mice with a relapsing-remitting form of the disease.\\nOur data indicate that aNPCs-once i.v. transplanted-may survive within the CNS for long periods of time and protect from relapsing-remitting EAE owing to their capability to selectively reach perivenular inflamed area where stem cell surviving factors are expressed.\\nBackground: Although neural precursor cells remyelinate focal lesions, the mechanism of their beneficial effect in clinically relevant models of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unclear.\\nWe used MHC (RT1 in rats) identical EAE susceptible DA (RT1av1) and resistant ACI (RT1av1) rats and performed BMT studies before disease induction, at the peak of disease and in remission of EAE in DA rats with DA or ACI bone marrow after whole body irradiation with 10 Gy. In contrast to controls, BMT resulted in strong disease protection if applied after CNS lesions and clinical symptoms had evolved for subsequent autoantigen-induced relapses and CNS lesions.\\nThe aim of our study was to test this inhibitory capacity of astrocyte-induced regulatory T cells in vivo, using EAE model in DA rats.\\nWhen MBP-immunized rats were treated on a day 6 p.i. with astro-LNC or control LNC and 2 days later, draining LNC were collected, restimulated in vitro and injected into naRve recipients, 9 out of 10 control animals developed EAE while none of six animals that received cells from astro-LNC group showed any sign of disease.\\nOur results suggest important role of astrocyte-induced regulatory T cells in the regulation of CNS inflammation.\\nExperimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is an animal model for the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) characterized by a CD4+ T cell mediated inflammatory response to central nervous system (CNS) autoantigens.\\nWe addressed the effect of astrocyte unresponsiveness to IFN-gamma in EAE by studying transgenic (tg) mice expressing a dominant-negative IFN-gamma receptor under control of the GFAP-promoter (GFAP-dIFNgR mice) in comparison to age matched wild type (wt) syngenic mice.\\nNo differences in peripheral immune responses assessed by T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion were seen between tg-and wt-mice.\\nIt is well established that inhibition of alpha 4 beta 1 integrin (VLA-4) blocks immune cell influx into the CNS and provides benefit to patients and in animal model systems.\\nWe conclude that IL-4 gene therapy using HD-Ad vectors determines the recruitment of CD4+CD25+ T cells with suppressant function able to induce clinical and functional recovery in a murine model of multiple sclerosis.\\nConclusions: These data strengthen the view that MMPs are involved in the pathogenesis of EAE and provide clear evidence that virus-mediated delivery of their protein inhibitors can be effective in preventing the clinical disease.\\nObjective: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate if IVIG enters the CNS by passing through the blood-brain barrier during the acute course of EAE, and to assess if IVIG accumulates at the inflammatory foci.\\nResults: We observed a significant increased binding of IVIG to CNS tissue in rats with EAE that correlated with the degree of inflammation as assessed by histological evaluation.\\nWe studied an immunoregulatory role of ApoE in the development of EAE, an immune-mediated demyelinating disease by using ApoE-knockout (KO) mice as a model system.\\nThe clinical score, antigenspecific proliferation response and cytokine production of regional lymph node (LN) cells, anti-MOG35-55 IgG antibody titers, and histopathology of the spinal cord were studied.\\nWhilst it is commonly assumed that estrogens exert their effect by modulating immune functions, we show here that 17h-estradiol (E2) treatment can inhibit mouse EAE without affecting autoantigen-specific T cell responsiveness and type-1 cytokine production.\\nOur data show that the protective effect of E2 on clinical EAE and CNS-inflammation was not dependent on ERalpha-signaling in inflammatory T cells.\\nIn conclusion, our data demonstrate that the beneficial effect of E2 on this autoimmune disease does not involve ERalpha-signaling in blood-derived inflammatory cells, and indicate that ERalpha expressed in other tissues, such as CNS-resident microglia or endothelial cells, mediates this effect.\\nIn conclusion, Smad7 inhibition represents a novel systemic treatment strategy targeting autoimmune inflammation, augmenting TGF-beta-signalling at sites of TGFbeta-activation without TGF-beta-associated toxicity.\\nThe therapeutic efficacy of M2000 as a novel immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agent in T cell-mediated autoimmune disease was tested.\\nCollectively, our data suggest that M2000 may provide a novel therapeutic option for T cell-mediated autoimmune diseases in animal models and possibly in man.\\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of murine interferonbeta (mIFN-beta) or dexamethasone (DEX) on myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in female C57BL/6 mice, a murine model for the human disease multiple sclerosis (MS).\\nWe used T-cell proliferation assays, ELISA, flow cytometry, real-time PCR, and histopathology to characterize the autoimmune response in IL-12-treated and control mice.\\nThe suppression of EAE was accompanied by induction of IFNgamma and TNF-alpha and inhibition of MOG-induced T cell proliferation in IL-12 treated mice.\\nThe TGF-beta family of proteins are secreted molecules with potent immunoregulatory properties and they control many activities of macrophages such as expression of MHCII, chemotaxis, production of cytokines and their receptors, production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide.\\nThe effects of flecainide on T cell activation were also examined following its subcutaneous injection in animals with EAE induced by immunisation with spinal cord homogenate.\\nPlasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)-associated genes, as defined in mice and human pDCs, were differentially expressed in DNA-vaccinated rats compared to controls.\\nTIRC7 is a membrane molecule expressed early in lymphocyte activation and anti-TIRC7 therapy inhibits Th1-cell antigen-responsiveness.\\nmAb effects on EAE in mice immunized with peptide (PLP139-151) were studied by comparing clinical signs, brain immunohistochemistry, lymphocyte proliferation, and cytokine levels in mAb-treated and untreated animals.\\nClinical improvements were typically accompanied by reduced mononuclear cell infiltration in EAE lesions in mAb-treated compared with untreated mice.\\nTreated mice had lower splenocyte IFN-gamma and IL-6 expression and reduced T-cell proliferation compared with controls.\\nHemmer Clinical Neuroimmunology Group, Department of Neurology, Philipps University, Marburg, Germany B cells are frequently found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with neuroinflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and various infectious CNS diseases.\\nThe objective of the present study was to characterize the phenotype and kinetics of B cell subpopulations in the CSF and blood of patients with MS and infectious diseases in order to dissect differences between chronic and acute inflammatory CNS diseases.\\nFor this purpose, we performed serial analyses of CSF and blood cells by flow-cytometry in patients with MS and acute infectious diseases such as lyme meningoradiculitis or viral meningitis.\\nBecause ectopic lymphoid tissue developing at sites of chronic inflammation is thought to sustain local immune processes, we have investigated whether abnormal B-cell follicles could be identified in the CNS of MS patients.\\nMemory B cells expressed high level of CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules and up-regulated CCR1, CCR2 and CCR4 suggesting their activated state.\\nLymphotoxin-alpha, CXCL12 and CXCL13, key players in lymphoid neogenesis, were present in the CSF from MS and OIND patients and expressed in MS brain tissue providing a favourable microenvironment for B cell maturation.\\nThis study suggests that a compartimentalized B cell response occurs within the CNS during an ongoing inflammatory reaction, evolving through all stages of B cell differentiation observed in secondary lymphoid organs.\\nBAFF production in human brain by astrocytes: the The brain in multiple sclerosis (MS) provides a long-term survival niche for B cells and plasma cells, which give rise to persisting oligoclonal Ig. B cell activating factor of the TNF family (BAFF) plays a crucial role in B cell survival.\\nIn conclusion, our findings demonstrate that this novel molecular approach is useful to identify novel candidate antigens in MS that can be used as disease markers, and can be used to study the humoral immune response in MS.\\nThe finding in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients of oligoclonal IgG bands upon isoelectric focusing of cerebrospinal fluid and the partial clinical response to immunosuppressive drugs support the theory of a role for antibodies in the disease.\\nUsing immunocytochemistry with flow cytometry we showed that myasthenia gravis patients\\' sera, containing antibodies against MuSK, bind MuSK-expressing TE 671 rhabdomyosarcoma cells, and that MuSK can be immunoprecipitated from TE 671 cell extracts by these sera and identified on Western blots.\\nAdditional experiments showed that sera containing GM1-IgG (n=41), GQ1b-IgG (n=32), GD1a-IgG (n=5) and GM2-IgG (n=2) induced leukocyte activation as measured by degranulation in 59%, 84%, 80%, and 100%, respectively, of the patient sera investigated.\\nMicroarray analysis supported by real time RT-PCR revealed a significant increase in mRNA levels of specific PDE subtypes in lymph node cells and muscles of myasthenic rats.\\nWe confirmed that B cell deficient mice are fully susceptible to the development of MOG-induced EAE regardless of whether peptides or recombinant MOG was used to immunize.\\nTaken together, our data dismiss any involvement of humoral immunity in MOG-induced EAE and demonstrate that FcR-gamma-deletion affects T lymphocytes rather than FcR-bearing accessory cells.\\nDiscriminant patterns of IgG self reactivity against brain antigens have been described in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, highlighting the possibility of B cell involvement.\\nGiven the abnormalities in B-cell activity occurring in the central nervous system (CNS) of multiple sclerosis patients, we investigated whether autoimmunity triggers CNS expression of molecules regulating the development and functional organization of lymphoid follicles, the sites where B-cell responses are initiated.\\nWe found that gene expression of CXCL13, a chemokine facilitating B-cell recruitment into follicles, and BAFF, a regulator of B-cell survival, is markedly upregulated in the CNS of SJL mice with PLP 139-151-induced, relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).\\nIntracisternal injection of the lymphotoxin-beta receptor-Ig fusion protein which blocks the action of lymphotoxin alpha/beta, a key cytokine in lymphoid organ development, either delayed or completely suppressed EAE relapses, and reduced B-cell proliferation in the CNS.\\nThey also suggest that local targeting of molecules involved in B-cell immunity or lymphoid tissue development should be considered as a possible therapeutic strategy to control CNS autoimmune disease.\\nTo identify putative antigenic targets of MS oligoclonal IgG, we developed a transient mammalian expression system to produce recombinant antibodies that utilize rearranged V-region sequences of plasma cell clones.\\nWe detected high anti-MOG IgG responses in patients with acute disease exacerbations ( Pb0.001) and secondary chronic progressive disease compared to controls ( P=0.001).\\nIncreasing evidence, both from studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and MS suggests an involvement of autoreactive antibodies in the immunopathogenesis of CNS demyelination.\\nTo further our understanding of the involvement of CNSreactive autoantibodies, we are studying immunoglobulin gene rearrangements and the respective antigen specificities of individual B-and plasma cells in MS lesions.\\nImmunoglobulin heavy (H) and light (L) chain genes of individual microdissected cells will be amplified by RT-PCR and rearranged H and L chain genes cloned into vector systems suitable for the expression of recombinant antibodies, which then will be screened for antigen specificity.\\nFrequent patient serum IgG reactivity was observed against a 60-kDa human pituitary antigen, and the cross-reactive 62 kDa protein from rat brain was identified as alpha-internexin (alpha-INX) by proteomic methods.\\nBy using alpha-INX containing cytoskeletal extracts for AAb screening, IgG and IgM AAbs to this neuron-specific type IV intermediate filament (IF) protein were found in most patient sera as well as in healthy subjects with no significant differences in frequencies between the groups, but the levels of IgM alpha-INX AAbs were higher in patients with hypopituitarism as compared to healthy controls ( p=0.032, Mann-Whitney U-test).\\nThese results further suggest that a thymoma-associated immune dysregulation underlies the generation of antibodies towards different self antigens, whose pathogenetic role remains to be defined.\\nMeasurement of autoantibodies to a muscle specific tyrosine kinase receptor (MuSK) may be useful in the assessment and management of patients with acetylcholine receptor antibody (AChRAb) negative myasthenia gravis (MG), and we have developed a new and convenient assay for MuSKAb measurement based on 125I-labelled purified recombinant MuSK.\\nUsing ELISA, we investigated the prevalence and levels of anti-GAD antibodies in patients with gluten ataxia (the most common neurological manifestation of gluten sensitivity) and patients with coeliac disease only in comparison to controls.\\nThe aim of the current study was to investigate the avidity and cerebellar target(s) of these antibodies using sodium thiocyanate elution assays, 2D gel electrophoresis, Western blotting and mass spectrometry in comparison to patients with coeliac disease only and appropriate control groups.\\nThere is an unmeet need to develop specific biomarkers for multiple sclerosis (MS) to improve the management of patients and the monitoring of the effectiveness of treatment.\\nCirculating specific CD8+ T cell responses are unknown in autoimmune diseases with central nervous system (CNS) involvement.\\nTwenty-five HLA-A2 patients (13 with relapsing-remitting MS, 4 with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) at high risk for MS, 2 neurolupus and 3 SLE without CNS involvement, 3 healthy volunteers) were labelled on blood with PE-HLA-A*0201 tetramers loaded with myelin specific peptides according to previously published CD8+ T-cell responses to human myelin protein-derived peptides (iTAg, Beckman Coulter, Europe): MBP110-118: SLSRFSWGA; PLP80-88: FLYGALLLA; MAG556-564: VLFSSDFRI; along with CD3-FITC and CD8-PerCP antibodies, and analysed on a flow cytometer.\\nPrevious studies demonstrated that an imbalance between Th1 and Th2 type cytokine mRNA level in PBMC of RR MS patients preceded the occurrence of increased disease activity.\\nTo determine whether OPN may contribute to this phenomenon, the relation between OPN serum levels and disease activity was investigated in a longitudinal study of sixteen RR MS patients undergoing monthly clinical and MRI examinations.\\nThese data indicate that OPN plays a role in increased disease activity in RR MS patients.\\nTo clarify which disturbances in cell-mediated immunity in blood and the central nervous system (CNS) are associated with the active phase of multiple sclerosis (MS), paired peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained from 36 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and examined for the percentages of lymphocyte subsets and levels of soluble immune mediators.\\nActive RRMS patients (n=27) were characterized by an increase in CD4 + CXCR3 + Th1 cells in blood, which was inversely correlated with plasma levels of IL-10 and IL-12p70.\\nWe also studied the clinical relevance of these cellular immune parameters by determining their percentages in another group of 31 non-treated inactive RRMS patients, and found that an increase in CSF CD4 + CD25 + cells predicted an exacerbation of MS within 3 months.\\nThese findings suggest that flow cytometric analysis of CSF CD4 + CD25 + cells provides a good measure of ongoing inflammation in the CNS as well as indication of aberrant immunity leading to MS relapse in the near future.\\nWe applied a multivariate statistical analysis on results obtained by measuring-by real-time RT-PCR-mRNA levels of 25 immunological relevant molecules (e.g., cytokines, chemokines and chemokine receptors) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 198 MS patients.\\nOur results indicate that multi-parametric analysis of mRNA levels of immunological relevant molecules in PBMCs may represent a successful strategy for the identification of putative peripheral markers of disease state and disease activity in MS patients.\\nAnti-GM1 antibodies were found in 97 (21%) of 462 patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), 2 (5%) of 41 chronic demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy, 5 (50%) of 10 multifocal motor neuropathy, 9 (6%) of 143 inflammatory polyneuropathy (I-PNP), 2 (3%) of 72 noninflammatory polyneuropathy (NI-PNP), 7 (9%) of 78 motor neuron disease, none of 20 multiple sclerosis, 3 (2%) of 142 other forms of autoimmune diseases and 3 (2%) of 124 healthy controls.\\nConclusions: Newly diagnosed MS patients display, concomitantly with MRI activity, increased terminally differentiated CD8+ alpha-beta T cells in presence of a reduction of defined regulatory T cells subsets.\\nWe investigated gene expression, by microarrays, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 7 MS patients at baseline, and after 1 and 3 months of interferon-beta (Rebif 44 mcg).\\nThe influence of IFN-beta on gene expression was more pronounced after one than after 3 months of therapy, involving genes of immunological significance and others related to energy metabolism, cell cycle and cytoskeleton dynamics.\\nIn accord with previous reports on a reduced expression of HLA-DR on PBMC in MS and in other autoimmune diseases, RT-PCR showed that RAB7 was decreased in untreated MS patients compared to healthy controls (including three disease discordant monozygotic twin sets).\\nTo detect if this responsiveness is generated by the shift in cytokine production, we studied a group of MS patients with monthly pulse methylprednisolone (MP) and cyclophosphamide (CPA) therapy.\\nStrikingly significant difference (pN0.000001) was detected in production of IFN gamma, TNF alpha, IL2, IL10 and IL12 between MS patients and healthy controls suggesting that the immune hyperactivation is present in the disease even in the second decade of its duration and despite aggressive treatment.\\nWe assessed the clinical response and the mechanism of IFN beta in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients by CSF analysis.\\nWe studied by ELISA cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum levels of classical soluble HLA-I (sHLA-I) and non-classical soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G) molecules in 69 relapsing-remitting (RR), 21 secondary progressive (SP) and 13 primary progressive (PP) multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, grouped according to clinical and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) evidence of disease activity, and 183 patients with other inflammatory neurological disorders (OIND) and non-inflammatory neurological disorders (NIND).\\nAnalysis of cerebrospinal fluid mononuclear cells (CSF-MC) obtained from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) revealed significantly higher mRNA expression of TIM-1 compared to controls.\\nThese data imply the differential expression of human TIM molecules by Th1 and Th2 cells and may suggest their differential involvement in different phases of a human autoimmune disease.\\nBackground: Currently, none of the myelin-associated antigen targets conclusively discriminates between the immune response observed in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and healthy subjects.\\nA recent study in our laboratory found that the analysis of global IgG immune profiles to whole brain self-antigens discriminated MS subjects from healthy subjects, and could also differentiate between the three clinical forms of the disease.\\nObjective: To measure serum leptin levels among different subgroups of patients with multiple sclerosis, a predominantly Th1 mediated inflammatory condition.\\nMethods: Fourteen recently diagnosed relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients, ten (10) RRMS patients on immunomodulatory drug therapy and thirteen primary progressive multiple sclerosis patients and age-matched nine control subjects were included in the study.\\nResults: The mean leptin level were 2.9, 3.0, 3.1 and 3.9 ng/ml in controls, newly diagnosed RRMS, RRMS on immunomodulatory treatment and primary progressive MS patients respectively.\\nConclusions: Although statistical analysis is still in progress, our preliminary observations support the use of cDNA microarray technology for detection of altered gene expression profiles in the periphery of MS patients during active disease.\\nMethods: After 6 months of IFN-beta-1b 250 mcg treatment, patients with persisting disease activity were randomized to either continue on 250 mcg dose or receive an increased dose (375 mcg).\\nTo determine the fine specificity of individual immune cells in SSPE brain, and to develop techniques to analyze IgG repertoires in other chronic inflammatory CNS diseases, we microdissected individual plasma cells from SSPE brain and identified the specific IgG sequences expressed by each cell.\\nStudies of specific rIgG reactivities have the potential to identify the antigens in other chronic inflammatory CNS diseases of unknown cause, such as multiple sclerosis and Behcet\\'s disease.\\nOf interest, the high quote of PCR positivity for Hsp-70 gene (a primary immunogen which elicits the inflammatory response during chlamydial disease) in these patients and previously demonstrated in MS disease (Contini et al., Multiple Sclerosis, in press) may be interpreted as a part of a stress response which can trigger an autoimmune reactivity.\\nMethods/ Materials: Sera of 84 patients (mean disease duration: 7.8 years; range: 1 to 35) were analysed using Western blotting (WB) for anti-gliadin IgA/IgG Ab, followed by quantitation using densitometer.\\nAnti-TPI IgM antibody titers were measured quantitatively using ELISA and the same 8 patients showed a significantly high antibody titer above mean +3SD of healthy controls (n=45), which decreased over time in patients checked in a time course evaluation.\\nWith the aim of investigating this issue we evaluated a series of 49 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke, and, within 24 h from stroke onset, the serum concentrations of a panel of different biomarkers previously reported to be associated with stroke: TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, MMP-1, MMP-2/9 and BDNF.\\nOn the contrary, and in contrast to previous reports, IL-6 showed a significant inverse correlation ( pb0.001) being up-regulated in patients who developed a milder severity score after three months.\\nTo evaluate the role of humoral parameters in the genesis of VaD in elderly patients, we investigated a group of 30 patients with VaD and compared the results with those of 30 cerebrovascular non-demented patients (VaND) and 30 healthy controls subjects without cerebral ischemic episodes.\\nThe number of Treg cells in the peripheral blood of untreated patients was significantly lower than in healthy subjects (HS) and increased after immunosuppressive (IS) therapy.\\nSixteen cytokines, IL-1h, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-17, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, G-CSF, MCP-1 and MIP-1beta, in CSF supernatant were measured by a multiplexed fluorescent-bead based immunoassay; and intracellular cytokine production of IFN-gamma and IL-4 in CSF CD4+ T cells by flowcytometry, in 14 patients with CIDP, 8 patients with VN and 24 other non-inflammatory neurologic diseases (OND).\\nAloe National Research Council (CNR), Rome, Italy Both in animal models and humans allergic bronchial asthma (ABA) can increase Nerve growth factor (NGF) levels in the blood serum and bronchial alveolar lavage (BALF).\\nOVA treated rats revealed significant increase in IgE, TNF-alpha levels, mast cells in the lung and eosinophils in both BALF and lung tissues.\\nWhen patients were stratified according to presence or absence of concomitant ischemic heart disease (IHD) a significant decrease in MMP 9 levels was observed (33.6%) only in the IHD-free group.\\nIn eleven patients that developed restenosis, MMP-9 was significantly decreased (-50%), while in the no-restenosis group a significant increase in TIMP-1 levels was observed (+9.9%).\\nWe studied the effect of HQ on cultured microglia, the activation of which is thought to be crucial to the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), and on the course of mice afflicted with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS.\\nFinally, we tested HQ in monophasic EAE and found that 100 mg/kg given as a pretreatment completely prevented the development of disease; this was correlated with lack of signs of microglia activation in treated animals.\\nEpidemiological studies showed that nicotine may be protective in some neurodegenerative pathologies, such as Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, in which chronic inflammation, sustained by microglial cells, plays a crucial role.\\nOur study is in line with the hypothesis of an anti-inflammatory effect of nicotine and suggests that the development of molecules able to stimulate the alpha7 receptor represent potential therapeutic tools for the treatment of several inflammatory neuropathologies.\\nThese findings suggest that whether the local immune response in the damaged CNS will be beneficial or harmful depends on how the microglia interpret the threat, and that a well-regulated T-cell-mediated response serves as a self-contained mechanism of repair.\\nFrom these studies, we have identified patterns of gene expression that 1) distinguish microglia from other myeloid populations, 2) reveal microglia are highly heterogeneous in the healthy CNS, and 3) indicate microglial responses to pathologic stimuli are heterogeneous even within a single pathology.\\nOur results suggest that ATP, by regulating OP mobilization and differentiation, could affect remyelination in inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system like multiple sclerosis.\\nChemokines are a group of cytokines involved in immune system signaling, which have recently been postulated to regulate central nervous system (CNS) development and function.\\nOli-neu cells express CXCR4, the receptor for SDF-1alpha, and SDF-1alpha-mediated induction of proliferation could be inhibited by addition of an anti-CXCR4 blocking antibody.\\nIn multiple sclerosis (MS), both humoral and cellular immune mechanisms directed to GL have been suggested to be play a pathogenetic role; however, the cellular distribution of GL on glial cells in situ has not been clearly assessed, thus hampering pathogenetic correlations with autoimmune responses.\\nThe aim of this study was to assess the pattern of expression in situ of GL on glial cells in adult normal central nervous system (CNS) and in chronic MS lesions, focusing on mature oligodendrocytes and their precursors (OP).\\nIn this study, MS lesions at different stages and CNS tissue from normal and disease controls were evaluated for the expression of SHH, its receptor Patched (PTC), Olig1, and Olig2 by immunocytochemistry and Western blot.\\nTumour necrosis factor (TNF) is a major immunomodulatory proinflammatory cytokine that\\'s been identified as having a pathogenic role in a number of inflammatory diseases within the central nervous system including multiple sclerosis and the animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).\\nTREM-2 cross-linking promotes DC migration and activation in vitro, suggesting that it may have a role in antigen presentation and T cell stimulation in vivo.\\nStaining with a soluble form of TREM-2 has revealed that both primary astrocytes and astrocytoma cell lines, either of mouse or human origin, express detectable levels of TREM-2 ligand.\\nCurrent data suggest that TREM-2 might modulate differentiation and activation of microglial cells, possibly by modulating responsiveness to certain cytokines or reinforcing signalling pathways triggered by cytokine receptors, integrins or chemokine receptors.\\nGlowinski INSERM U114, College de France, Paris, France The brain macrophage (BM) cell population already considered heterogeneous in terms of phenotype expression pattern also exert, upon activation, dual functions resulting in either beneficial or detrimental effects on neuron survival.\\nBM isolated from newborn (P1) mouse brain cell cultures were examined under bacterial lipopolysaccharide stimulation by intracellular immunofluorescence staining with specific antibodies to TNFalpha and IL10, as candidates of the proand anti-inflammatory families of cytokines, respectively.\\nSecreted cytokines can tune the functional capability of microglial cells by shaping them in fully competent antigen presenting cells through a bclassical activationQ or inducing a phenotype mostly associated with antiinflammatory process, healing and induction of tolerance which is often called balternative activationQ.\\nGM-CSF is a growth factor present only during inflammatory conditions in the adult brain which is also known to regulate the antigen presenting cell function of microglia.\\nIn Alzheimer\\'s disease, also characterized by a microglial-induced proinflammatory response, the use of agonists to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) has been shown to reduce amyloid-beta stimulated cytokine expression by microglia.\\nStimulation of the cells with fibrillar PrP106-126 resulted in strong induction of expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor-necrose-factor alpha (TNFalpha) as measured by ELISA, whereas non-fibrillar and scrambled peptide had no effect on microglial cells.\\nWe studied the influence of FK506 on microglia morphology and cytokine expression in LPS-activated microglial cells.\\nIn most neurodegenerative disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\\'s disease, and Alzheimer\\'s disease, a massive neuronal cell death occurs as a consequence of an uncontrolled inflammatory response, where activated microglia and its cytotoxic agents play a crucial pathologic role.\\nMicroglia are innately refractory to nitric oxide-inducing stimuli, but acquire responsiveness following differentiation by colony-stimulating factors C.A. Brannan and M.R. Roberts Department of Microbiology and Medicine, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA Microglia are the immunoregulatory cells of the central nervous system (CNS), and share many characteristics with resident macrophages in extracerebral tissues.\\nMacrophages secrete nitric oxide (NO) following NF-kappaB/IFN-dependent transcriptional activation of the NO synthase gene (NOS2) by stimuli elicited during a T cell response or by microbial products.\\nNO plays a key role in regulating both adaptive and innate immune responses, including inhibition of T cell proliferation and elimination of intracellular pathogens.\\nAccording to in vitro studies, microglia activated by amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides have been reported to damage or kill neurons by the release of neurotoxic molecules such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nitric oxide or reactive oxygen species.\\nIn this study, we have attempted to elucidate effects of PS-liposomes, mimicking apoptotic cells, on the inflammatory response of Abeta-activated microglia.\\nStudies carried out in transgenic (Tg) mice constitutively expressing a GR antisense RNA from early embryonic life establish a link between GRs and iNOS-derived NO and demonstrate that lack of GR regulation of NO exacerbates experimentally induced parkinsonism.\\nStudies carried out in female mice deprived of endogenous ovarian hormones show exacerbation of MPTPinduced loss of DA neuron function preceded by a strong astroglial activation and iNOS expression, resulting in massive death of astrocytes and neurons, whereas E2 replacement therapy sharply inhibits iNOS expression, counteracts astrocyte apoptosis and restores neurochemical parameters of DA neuron functionality, pointing to endogenous steroid hormones as prime modulators of iNOS inducibility and crucial checkpoints in MPTP-induced neuroinflammation.\\nNucleotides mediated release of neurotrophins and activation of CRE-dependent cell survival response may be assumed as a solid rationale for the possible use of P2Y2 receptors in the development of new therapeutic strategies in immune and neurological disorders.\\nAs immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory drugs are known to modify glial expression, this study was designed to investigate astrocyte immunoreactivity to Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) after EB injection in animals submitted to dexamethasone (DX) treatment.\\nIn this study, we tested the hypothesis that activation of P2X7 receptors with BzATP, an analog of ATP, leads to the modulation of the expression of genes related to inflammation.\\nThe expression of ADAMTS-1, -4 and -5 was studied in primary human astrocytes at the mRNA and protein level using real time RT-PCR, western blotting and immunocytochemistry.\\nThis data indicates that during inflammation there is an imbalance in ADAMTS and TIMP3 expression, which could cause increased enzyme activity resulting in breakdown of the CNS ECM and prevention of angiogenesis.\\nactivated astrocytes and microglia and that exposure to oxidative/nitrosative stress, such as serum deprivation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), time-and dose-dependently up-regulate Mrp1 expression and induce extensive membrane targeting.\\nAt a functional level, this effect is accompanied by enhanced Fluo-3-extruding activity and reduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species accumulation, whereas exposure to Mrp1 inhibitor MK571 sharply impaired such phenomena, implicating glial Mrp1 as a key redox sensor during brain inflammation.\\nThe object of the present study is to identify the receptor(s) involved in myelin basic protein (MBP) uptake and to evaluate their role in the subsequent MBP processing and presentation by human astroglial cells: central events in the demyelinating process.\\nOur study deals with cultured astroglial cells, stimulated with MBP or its peptide fragments in order to evaluate heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and HLA class II antigen expression by cytometric analysis, RT-PCR and Western blots.\\nWhile we have recently described that contact with astrocytes induces development of regulatory T cells, in the present study we investigated the mechanisms responsible for their suppressive properties.\\nHeat-sensitive and protein synthesis inhibition-sensitive soluble T cell factors, not including TGF-beta or IL-10, were solely responsible for the observed suppression, which did not depend either on nitric oxide production, prostaglandin release, or tryptophan consumption.\\nFinally, the cells with suppressive properties were readily generated upon contact of astrocytes and human T lymphocytes, indicating their potential therapeutic value in the treatment of CNS autoimmunity.\\nCalpains are a family of calcium-activated proteases that have been recently implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis for both their ability to degrade myelin proteins and for their presence, at increased levels, in activated glial/inflammatory cells of MS plaques.\\nThese results suggest that IFN-beta could modulate the expression of calpains in astrocytes and this effect could represent an additional mechanism by which IFN-beta decreases the development of new CNS lesions in course of MS.\\nTo further understand these in vivo findings, we have investigated the expression of CXCL10 and CCL2 by primary adult human astrocytes in vitro following treatment with pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines.\\nBackground: Toll-like receptors play key roles in the recognition of invariant pathogen-associated molecules by the innate immune system and generally mediate pro-inflammatory responses to these agonists.\\nWe previously showed expression of various TLR family members on glial cells in the human central nervous system (CNS) and elevated levels of these TLR during neuroinflammation.\\nIn this study, we show increased expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), an enzyme known to be associated with inflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, in the brainstem tissues of ts1-infected mice.\\nCOX-2 is also upregulated in ts1-infected cultured astrocytes, but this effect is significantly decreased by treatment of the cells with curcumin and by SP600125, both of which specifically inhibit the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs)/c-Jun pathway.\\nAstrocyte-expressed tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 is an important molecule in CNS homeostasis and inflammatory diseases including HIV-1-associated dementia (HAD).\\nOchani and K.J. Tracey North Shore University Hospital, Long Island Jewish Research Institute, Manhasset, NY, USA Endotoxin, a constituent of Gram-negative bacteria, stimulates macrophages to release pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which can cause lethal shock and tissue injury.\\nThe Treg induced by co-culture with VIP-DC inhibit the proliferation of responder T cells, and this inhibition is completely reversed by the addition of a mix of neutralizing Abs (anti-IL10+anti-TGFbeta+anti-CTLA-4) suggesting that the suppressive activity is mediated by both cellular contact and cytokines.\\nMaestroni Istituto Cantonale di Patologia, Locarno, Switzerland Toll-like receptors (TLRs) expressed in dendritic cells (DCs) alert the innate immune system to the presence of pathogens so that the appropriate response can be mounted to contain the infection.\\nIn the preceding work, we showed that the sympathetic nervous system may influence the antigen-presenting and Th priming ability of DCs. Here we report that murine epidermal Langherans cells as well as lymphoid and the myeloid DCs express the mRNA coding for the cannabinoid CB2 receptor.\\nConsistently, 2-AG showed a potent chemotactic activity in vitro toward DCs. As 2-AG production may by induced by inflammatory agents, we have identified an endogenous lipid mediator which might influence the choice of the appropriate immune response to a pathogen.\\nWe have demonstrated that treatment with VIP reduced the clinical and histopathological severity of TNBS-induced colitis by decreasing the inflammatory and Th1-driven autoimmune components of the disease, but nothing is known about the putative involvement of TLRs both in the disease and healing.\\nThe present study demonstrates that the modulation of TLR2 and TLR4 receptors is involved in the beneficial effects of VIP in an animal model of Crohn\\'s disease, representing a new step in the design of potential therapeutic strategies.\\nDuring pregnancy, we observed a progressive increase in CD4+CD25+ T-lymphocytes in healthy as well as MS patients, whereas a decrease in activated T-cells was noted.\\nThe nearer the HLA expression was situated to the CRH neurons, the stronger the inhibiting effect, suggesting that activated microglial cells or macrophages suppress these neurons.\\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro effect of these neurotransmitters, individually and jointly, on several inflammatory parameters of peritoneal leucocytes, such as adherence to fibronectin and collagen type I, PGE2 and NO release as well as susceptibility to H 2 O 2 -induced apoptosis.\\nThe aim of the present study was to determine the molecular mechanisms of action of VIP on this model of colitis studying the time-course expression of proinflammatory and regulatory mediators implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease.\\nTNBS-mice showed an increased expression of all proinflammatory mediators studied, with a specific time course pattern for each molecule.\\nBesides, TNBS-treated animals showed a Th1 lymphocytic response with high levels of IFN gamma mRNA but low IL-4, correlated with a high expression of IL-12 and IL-18, two Th1 differentiating factors.\\nNeuropeptide Y (NPY) is involved in the modulation of functions related to immune and inflammatory reactions such as lymphocytes proliferation, NK cell activity, immune cell trafficking, cytokine secretion and release of oxidative agents.\\nET-1 (100 nM) also induced an increase in PGE 2 release from the POA but not from the PHyp. RNase protection analyses of total RNA extracted from the explants showed that 100 nM ET-1 produced no effect on interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 gene expression.\\nThe aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of ICV injections of PAT on the increased intracerebral levels of cytokines induced by ICV injection of ET.\\nThe melatonin neurohormone plays an important role in the immune system, which is also supported by the existence of melatonin-specific binding sites in lymphoid cells, central nervous system and peripheral organs.\\nWe have previously reported [Science 245 (1989) 188-190 ) that microinjections of morphine into the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) of the rat midbrain suppresses natural killer (NK) cell activity, thus implicating this brain region in the regulation of immune function by opioids.\\nMitogenic stimulation by PHA and LPS induced the production of IL-4 and IFNgamma from spleen cells of control mice, but exposure to toluene gave no significant increase in the cytokine production.\\nResults: A decrease or a not significant increase in BAR number was found, respectively, on T cells from hypo-and hyperthyroid and ISO-stimulation of cAMP was lower in hypothyroid and higher in hyperthyroid T lymphocytes, respect to controls.\\nSince interferon (IFN)-beta positively modifies MS course, we investigated CA production, expression of mRNA for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, the limiting enzyme in CA synthesis), and apoptosis in PBMCs from patients undergoing treatment.\\nPharmacological inhibition of CA production significantly reduces apoptosis in healthy subjects: this effect was not observed in MS patients, even during IFN-beta therapy.\\nOur results suggest that IFN-beta treatment antagonises IFN-gamma on TH mRNA expression and CA production, but its relevance on activation-induced apoptosis remains unclear.\\nEAE is a animal chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) serving as a useful model for human multiple sclerosis (MS).\\nA better understanding of how CD45 dim VLA-4 + cells suppress harmful immune response of EAE may explain the induction of immune tolerance during pregnancy and lead to novel therapeutic approaches to combat MS and other autoimmune diseases.\\nCortisol, cytokines and symptom severity in patients with schizophrenia during treatment with risperidone and haloperidol X.Y. Zhang Peking University, Beijing, P.R. China Backgrounds: The aim of this study was to investigate the inter-relationships among cortisol, cytokines and symptoms in schizophrenia, and to compare the effects of typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs on these variables.\\nAmong several studied parameters, results from questionnaires, phenotyping of white blood cells, cytokine assays, urine cortisol measurements are presented.\\nSome immune parameters, such as NK cell numbers and cytokine profiles were differentially regulated in atopic and healthy individuals in response to stress.\\nAs both nitric oxide and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) are common messengers to nervous and immune systems mediating secretory and inflammatory responses, we examined nitric oxide synthase activity with special focus on VIP-mediated effects in salivary glands of NOD mice and Th1/Th2 cytokine balance in sera and glands.\\nObjective: To determine if neuropsychiatric manifestations in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are influenced by anti-DNA antibodies cross-reacting with the human N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor types NR2a or NR2b.\\nUsing the NPA-PCR/V betaspecific PCR, we demonstrated high proportions of identical beta-chain TCR transcripts in the CSF of seven out of seven patients with schizophrenia or affective disorders, suggesting the presence of antigen(s)-driven clonally expanded population of T cells.\\nOur study performed on post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients within 8 years from traumatic event revealed elevated plasma cortisol level and lower glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) expression in examined lymphocyte populations opposite to studies performed decades following exposure to trauma.\\nOur main goal was to study: (1) the influence of acute and chronic d-amphetamine treatment on ConAinduced lymphocyte proliferation in rats, (2) the participation of dopaminergic and opioidergic systems in these effects, (3) the amphetamineinduced effects on proenkephalin and derived peptides in immune organs and different CNS areas.\\nThe objective of the present study was to establish the effect of MSH peptides on IL-1 beta-induced anxiety-like behavior and the type of melanocortin receptors involved.\\nThese findings suggest a possible involvement of the innate immunity in thymus alterations characterized by an abnormal cell proliferation, and evoke the possibility that antigen mimicry might play a crucial role in MG pathogenesis.\\nWe found that CCR5 À/À mice showed a similar EAN clinical course and severity as well as profile of infiltrating macrophage and T cells in cauda equina (CE) of EAN and the same levels of spleen mononuclear cell (MNC) response to antigen and mitogen when compared with CCR5 +/+ control mice.\\nTaken together, these data suggest that functionality of anti-ganglioside antibodies, as measured by in vitro assays, is associated with the presence of GBS clinical symptoms in rabbits, thus providing additional evidence for their pathogenic role in vivo.\\nThe association between anti-ganglioside antibodies and high CSF IgG production indexes value in GBS patients suggests a pathogenetic relationship between these findings.\\nResults: We found that (a) anti-C-Dps antibody was only present in GBS patients with preceding Cj infection (38.9%) and those with Cj enteritis (18.2%), (b) C-Dps bound to neurons in rat spinal cord and myelin sheath in rat peripheral nerves, (c) C-Dps bound specifically to sulfatide, (d) in vitro, C-Dps bound to PC12 cell surface and induced the LDH release from the cells.\\nToyoshima a a Akita University School of Medicine, Akita, Japan; b Akita City Hospital, Akita, Japan Patient: We are presenting a 33-year-old man who developed an external ophthalmoplegia during a course of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP).\\nConclusion: This case suggests that the patient with CIDP produced a wide diversity of antibodies, causing muscle weakness and external ophthalmoplegia, and maintained recovery by IVIg. CIDP associated with lung cancer: a paraneoplastic disease?\\nTo investigate the early development of fibrosis and TGF-beta1 involvement in murine disease, we evaluated diaphragms of 6-to 36-week-old mdx and C57BL6 mice by morphometric analysis, immunohistochemistry for collagens, and TGF-beta1 expression by real-time PCR and ELISA.\\nMorphometric analysis showed at 12 weeks of age a significant decrease of fibrosis and TGFbeta-1 mRNA levels in the group treated with anti-TGFbeta antibody.\\nC. Dalakas National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA To investigate effects of high dose prednisone (PRED) and intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) on chemokines, cytokines and beta-amyloid associated proteins, crucial for sIBM-pathogenesis.\\ncDNA was analyzed by quantitative (real-time) PCR in relation to GAPDH-expression, using sequence specific primers for chemokine-ligand CXCL9, CCL3, CCL4, interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, transforming-growth-factor (TGF)-beta, inducible-costimulator (ICOS) and -ligand (ICOS-L), perforin, amyloidprecursor-protein (APP) and ubiquitin.\\nIn order to determine, whether an engagement of RAGE might contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory myopathies, we studied the presence of CML, RAGE, and activated NF-kB by immunohistochemistry in muscle biopsies of patients with polymyositis (PM, n=8), dermatomyositis (DM, n=8) and in eight healthy controls.\\nBy TEPITOPE analysis, we have identified eight synthetic AChR sequences and tested T cell responses in PBMC of 74 MG patients and 51 healthy controls in proliferation studies.\\nThe overall reactivity observed among patients was significantly higher than healthy controls but the frequency of response varied with specific HLA-DR phenotypes.\\nIn order to investigate the role(s) of these autoantibodies in MG, primary human muscle cell cultures have been exposed to MG patient sera and the morphological effects observed.\\nCultured human muscle cells were exposed to MG patient or control sera (normal donor, systemic lupus erythematosus, or Sjogren\\'s syndrome patient sera) for 1-4 days, and observed by crystal violet staining and light microscopy.\\nIn order to know whether acetylcholinesterase (AChE) autoimmune plays a role in both myasthenia gravis (MG), which is associated with antibodies directed against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in 85% of patients, and Graves\\' disease (GD), we analysed by ELISA the ability of sera from 22 patients with MG without antibodies against AChR, 116 with GD having the antibodies against thyreoglobulin (Tg), and 50 healthy controls (CR) to react with AChE from human brain and human Tg. Results showed that significantly increased anti-AChE activity was exhibited by a high proportion of MG (50%) and nearly unchanged anti-AchE activity was observed in GD (1%) sera, being similar with CR, which no anti-AChE activity detected.\\nRecombinant erythropoietin (rEPO) treatment alters the number of circulating T-cells and CD4/CD8 ratio; these effects might influence immune responses pathways such as antigen presentation and/or recognition by T cells.\\nWillcox Neurosciences Group, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK Autoimmune CD4 T-cells that recognise peptides from the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) play an important role in the initiation and progression of Myasthenia Gravis (MG).\\nWe studied the frequency and nature of additional AID in patients with the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and their family members, in both small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) related and non-tumour (NT)-related cases.\\nBehari All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India Objectives: To assess the comparative efficacy of daily versus alternate day Plasmapharesis for inducing remission in patients with severe myasthenia gravis.\\nIn line with this anti-inflammatory activity of NGF are our recent results on the autocrine NGF synthesis in B lymphocytes, which directly regulate in these cells the expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a neuropeptide which is a potent inhibitor of T cell proliferation and antigen presentation by macrophages and monocytes.\\nOur findings indicate that endogenous synthesis of NGF in monocytes has a functional role and, by influencing B7.2 expression and IL-10 production, contributes to the downregulation of the immune response and strongly support the newly found anti-inflammatory activity of NGF.\\nResults: Lower clinical scores, less body weight loss, lower numbers of anti-AChR IgG antibody secreting cells and lower affinity of anti-AChR antibodies were observed in rats receiving IL-10-modified DC, accompanied with lower expression of CD80 and CD86 and lower lymphocyte proliferation compared with control EAMG rats.\\nThe C-type lectin DC-SIGN that is present on immature myeloid DC was expressed by cells accumulating around inflamed blood vessels, predominantly in chronic active lesions.\\nThe presence of immature and mature DC in chronic active MS lesions suggests that abnormal presentation of myelin antigens by these potent antigen presenting cells could break immune tolerance toward CNS antigens and allow continuous stimulation of autoimmune responses.\\nIn vitro studies demonstrated that PGN stimulates DC-mediated processes, reflected by increased antigen uptake, DC maturation, Th1 cell expansion, activation, and pro-inflammatory cytokine production.\\nThese data indicate that PGN-mediated interactions result in pro-inflammatory stimulation of antigen specific effector functions important for development of EAE.\\nMice harbouring a Tbb infection do not develop Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for human disease multiple sclerosis (MS), upon immunisation with recombinant myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (rMOG) in complete Freund\\'s adjuvant (CFA), and mice that are infected with the parasites at the time of immunisation or a week later develop less severe EAE.\\nProtected mice display a markedly diminished rMOG-specific proliferation and IFN-gamma production in lymph node cells, and have correspondingly low titres of serum anti-rMOG IgG.\\nWe studied the mechanisms of intravenous high dose soluble MBP application (HSM) in adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (tEAE) of the Lewis rat using gene engineered myelin basic protein specific T cells, which express the green fluorescent protein (TMBP-GFP cells) as marker gene.\\nThe morphological changes were associated with fast T cell activation: increase in cytokines mRNA expression was observed within 1 h and membrane phenotype rearrangement 2 h after HSM application.\\nOur data demonstrate that MMP-12, found in MS patients, exhibits a novel function: by destroying an immunodominant MBP-epitope, this protease could directly influence the cascade of MBP-specific T-cell autoreactivity in MS.\\nFinally, we demonstrate that transgenic mice expressing MHCII molecules exclusively on dendritic cells develop EAE induced by adoptive transfer.\\nOur data clearly show that CD11c+ dendritic cells are sufficient to present Ag to auto-reactive T cells thus mediating CNS inflammation and clinical disease development.\\nSerum of patients with multiple sclerosis induce activation of antigen presenting cells A.\\nWeiner b a Department of Neurology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel; b Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women\\'s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MS, USA Objective: To study the effect of serum from patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) on activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs).\\nPericytes may therefore function as a CNS antigen presenting cell (APC) and undergo TH1 or TH2-like polarization associated with alternatively activated phenotypes.\\nIn this context, gene expression analysis in murine models of autoimmunity revealed a functional role for the glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor (GITR) in CD25+CD4+ T cells and recently it was shown in humans that a forced expression of the Foxp3 gene, which encodes a transcription repressor gene, can convert CD4+ T cells to T suppressor cells.\\nIn a preliminary analysis using real time PCR, we could not observe any significant differences in FOXP3 and GITR mRNA expression levels between MS patients and healthy donors.\\nTherefore, we now extend our study employing gene expression microarray technology to assess gene expression differences in CD25+CD4+ T cells and DC between Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients and young healthy donors.\\nDifferentially expressed genes in these key cells of immunological tolerance may further our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of MS and provide new disease markers.\\nA contribution of microglia to the intracerebral DC population was delineated from the amyloid-related phenotype brain DC exhibit, the microglia-like morphology of cells expressing DC markers at parenchymal sites where any cellular infiltrate is lacking features that microglia share with immature DC, and the finding that microglia purified from adult brain can generate functional DC.\\nCoculture experiments of the different APC with T cells demonstrated the functional consequences of B7-H1 expression: the production of inflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma and IL-2) by T cells was markedly enhanced in the presence of a neutralizing anti-B7-H1 antibody.\\nTaken together, our data point to microglial B7-H1 as an important immune-inhibitory molecule that downregulates T cell activation in the CNS and would contribute to the regulation of local levels of inflammatory responses.\\nIn inflammatory CNS diseases, TC subsets cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to initiate immune responses by mechanisms presently poorly defined.\\nThese results indicate that cytokine-induced upregulation of immunoproteasome subunits is required for MHC I upregulation on HBMEC and suggest that the proteasome may influence antigen processing and presentation at the BBB in CNS inflammation.\\nCoculture experiments of MHC-class I/II-positive myoblasts with CD4 and CD8 T cells in the presence of antigen demonstrated the functional consequences of muscle-related B7-H1 and ICOSL expression: whereas ICOSL provided stimulated T cells, B7-H1 was a strong inhibitor of T cell cytokine production and activation.\\nWhereas ICOSL provides an augmentatory signal for muscle immune cell interactions, inducible expression of the immune inhibitory molecule B7-H1 provides evidence for the capability of muscle to promote immunoprotective mechanisms putatively involved in the regulation of local inflammation.\\nMSRV is a retroviral element previously isolated in cell cultures from MS patients and bearing pro-inflammatory properties characterized by the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in human PBMC cultures.\\nWe report here that the surface unit of MSRV envelope protein (ENV-SU) specifically induces human monocytes to produce major pro-inflammatory cytokines through a TLR4/CD14 dependent mechanism.\\nRecently, we have shown that a significantly higher portion of healthy elderly and AD subjects had strong Ab-reactive T-cell responses than occurred in middleaged adults, strongly dependent on certain HLA-DR class II alleles.\\nImmune infiltrates were targeted to sites of Ab plaques in the brain associated with enhanced microglia activation and clearance of Ab. Overall, we demonstrate that accumulation of Ab in the CNS, MHC genetic background, and inflammatory signal such as IFN-gamma are required to induce Ab-specific T-cell responses in the brain of APP-Tg mice similar to that observed in Ab-vaccinated patients with AD.\\nResults: T-cell and antibody responses to both neurofilament light and heavy were observed in adult SCH-induced EAE.\\nConclusions: Our data indicate that both T-cell and antibody responses against neurofilaments develop during chronic relapsing EAE in mice.\\nWe mucosally administered myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) (35-55) peptide to C57BL/6 mice prior to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to induce an anti-inflammatory T-cell response directed at CNS myelin.\\nNitsch Charité University Hospital, Berlin, Germany After mechanical lesions of the nervous system, activated T cells have been suggested to exert neuroprotective effects.\\nFurther, we show that expression of CD14 is increased in brains of AD patients in correlation with senile plaques, suggesting a clinical relevance of this receptor in AD.\\nWe report several major findings: (1) we provide evidence of axonal injury before significant parenchymal T-cell entry, (2) we demonstrate an association between axonal injury and astrocyte responses from presymptomatic stages and (3) differences in astrocytic responses in two forms of the disease.\\nThe demonstration that polymorphic genes in different loci control neurodegeneration and CNS inflammation has implications for various experimental rodent nervous system paradigms and this approach may lead to the identification of evolutionary conserved genetic polymorphisms in key controlling genes, which can serve as prime candidates for association studies in several human CNS disease.\\nAn increased understanding of the underlying mechanisms may lead to the development of new more specific treatment to protect resident cells and thus minimize progressive oligodendrocyte and axonal loss.\\nNo significant differences emerged-at a p=0.05, nonparametric test-for the elements under study as well as for parameters relating oxidative stress, with the exception of Mg (median values of 19,213 for patients and 17,881 ng/ml for controls at a p=0.03).\\nOur preliminary immunocytochemistry studies indicate that receptor-activity modifying protein-2 (RAMP-2) is normally expressed on ECV304 cells.\\nWe propose that this phenotype promotes an immune response that supports neuronal cell survival and repair, resulting in functional recovery.\\nThus, overt production of TNF-alpha and reactive NO by activated microglial cells blocks the motility of synaptic vesicle precursor via phosphorylation of JNK and may cause axonal and synaptic dysfunction in inflammatory and degenerative brain diseases.\\nIn this study, we have used both a cDNA superarray and real time PCR and observed a significant increase in the mRNA levels of the TNF receptor superfamily, including TNFR1, DR3, DR6 and the death ligand LT-beta following exposure of NSC-34 cells to LPS-activated BV-2 supernatant.\\nThese findings suggest that LPS activated microglial BV-2 supernatant can induce NSC-34 motor neuron cell apoptosis through a mitochondria-dependent signaling pathway and that TNF alpha is a major contributor to this process.\\nStudies in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the model of MS, demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of specific glutamate receptors suppresses symptoms and prevents blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown.\\nWe studied the effect of helper-dependent adenoviral vector (Ad) engineered with the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-4 gene and with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter gene, in a model of transient focal ischemia in mice.\\nThe DA rat displays a higher degree of neuronal loss and more intense glial activation than the PVG strain and this was associated with higher levels of several mRNAs coding for proteins known to be involved in inflammatory reactions.\\nDeng University of Verona, Verona, Italy Neurological diseases show a well known age-dependent prevalence; e.g. multiple sclerosis prevails in young and middle age and neurodegenerative diseases increase with aging, indicating that the response to inflammatory and neuronal death-inducing processes varies in the CNS during lifetime.\\nAfter cytokine treatment, marked activation of astrocytes and microglia, and Bcl-2 induction in neurons and some glial cells, were seen in both age groups, with age-related differences.\\nThe data point out that the brain cell response to an inflammatory challenge is age-dependent and involves gene expression in different cell types.\\nLapolla b , S.B. Solerte a a Department of Internal Medicine and Geriatrics, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy; b Department of Metabolic Sciences and Metabolism, University of Padova, Padova, Italy Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and glyco-oxidative mechanisms could induce a pro-inflammatory burst of cytokines from immune and microglial cells and a loss of neuroprotection.\\nSuggesting a clinical relevance of TLR4 in AD pathology in vivo, we observed that expression of TLR4 is upregulated in APP transgenic mice, the animal model of AD, in close association with microglia.\\nThe encoded proteins form an activating signal transduction complex in immune cells, but their function in the target tissues of PLOSL, central nervous system (CNS) and bone, is largely unknown.\\nFurther, the expression of DAP12/TREM2 in oligodendrocytes, the myelin producing cells of the CNS, agrees well with the histopathological and clinical findings of PLOSL patients.\\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Abeta and the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1beta on glial activation and the production of ROS in rat primary mixed glial cell cultures.\\nIn the present study, we examined nNOS, eNOS and iNOS gene expression in the striatum of C57BL/6 male mice (12 month old) in a murine model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6tetrahydropyridine (MPTP).\\nIncreased IFN gamma secretion from restimulated lymphocytes in patients immunized with autologous glioma cells correlates with prolonged survival P.\\nVisse Lund University, Lund, Sweden Introduction: In order to monitor the immune response of patients immunized with IFN gamma secreting tumor cells, peripheral blood leucocytes were assayed after restimulation for 5 days with tumor cells.\\nResults: Samples from five patients were analyzed and compared with survival data, immune infiltration and DTH reactions at the vaccination site.\\nPatients with glioblastoma, the most common and lethal intrinsic human brain tumor, are reported here to show decreased expression of the activating immunoreceptor NKG2D in CD8 T and NK cells.\\nIn order to identify novel markers useful for specific recognition of Neuroblastoma cells, we immunized mice with a Neuroblastoma cell line and after cell fusion, an mAb termed 5B14 was selected that stained all Neuroblastoma cell lines tested as well as tumors of different origin, including melanomas and carcinomas.\\nMore recently, many studies with both mouse and human tumor models have shown the importance of cytokine combinations in the development of optimal immune responses.\\nHere a pilot study is presented comparing the levels of a panel of cytokines in intracavitary cyst fluid from patients with brain tumours against their serum and normal serum controls.\\nResults: The levels for all these cytokines were significantly higher in intracavitary cyst fluid compared with patients and normal serum.\\nWe investigated the expression and the functional activity of novel B7 costimulatory molecules in human glioma cells in vitro and in vivo.\\nGlioma-related B7-H1 was identified as a strong inhibitor of CD4+ as well as CD8+ T cell activation as assessed by increased cytokine production (IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-10) and expression levels of the T cell activation marker (CD69) in the presence of a neutralizing antibody against B7-H1 (mAb 5H1).\\nIn the presence of conditioned medium from resting and LPS-activated microglia cultures, we did not observed changes in the activation of p38 MAPK, Erk and JNK kinases in glioma cells, as analysed by Western blot analysis with specific antibodies.\\nTreatment with AE significantly reduced cytokine-triggered expression of important iNOS transcription factor IRF-1 in C6 cells, while activation of NF-kappaB remained unaltered.\\nStimulation of NO synthesis in high density macrophages culture by AE was not affected by transcription or translation inhibitors, indicating that enzymatic activity, rather than gene expression, was a target for the drug action.\\nIn this study, we determined the specificity of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-infiltrating T cells from a patient with RR-MS in exacerbation using an unbiased approach in order to identify foreign agents that might have activated these T cells.\\nAnti-MOG antibodies induce extensive demyelination in T cell-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and bind to disintegrating myelin in acute multiple sclerosis (MS) and in the marmoset model of EAE.\\nThese observations motivate the search for anti-MOG antibodies in MS, in which increased MOG-specific T and B cell responses are reported.\\nWe recently demonstrated that the analysis of global IgG antibody response against human brain antigens using one-dimensional immunoblotting, allowed us to discriminate MS patients from controls (both healthy subjects and Sjfgren\\'s syndrome).\\nIndeed, T cell responses to myelin antigens are readily detectable in MS patients, indicating that self-tolerance or regulatory mechanisms have failed.\\nIn order to identify a gene expression pattern in peripheral immune cells from MS patients with potential diagnostic and prognostic implications, we performed a largescale gene expression analysis using DNA-microarrays (12,000 genes) in relapsing-remitting (RRMS) and primary progressive (PPMS) patients as well as in healthy individuals.\\nBy this approach, we defined an MS expression profile which is characterized by an increased expression of genes involved in cellular activity, chemotaxis, adhesion processes and transendothelial migration, and by a diminished expression of factors related to regulation of B-cell response and response to interferons.\\nThe identified expression profile indicates important aspects of the MS pathophysiology, highlighting the role of transendothelial migration as well as B-cell and IFN-related processes in MS immunopathology and offers a basis for the development of diagnostic markers in MS.\\nThese data indicate both HERV-W env provirus and viral RNA levels are increased in MS patients, which may reflect infectivity mediated by HERV-W envelope in astrocytes and macrophages, likely driven by concurrent innate immune activation.\\nHowever, more frequent expression of MSRV sequences detected in lymphocytes RNA, as well as their presence in higher frequency in serum of MS patients may suggest the involvement of MSRV in the etiopathogenesis on MS.\\nAntigen-specific T cells were analyzed by multicolour flow-cytometry in the peripheral blood of MS patients and controls; 28 MS patients were compared with 24 healthy donors (HD) using an HLA-B7 EBV peptide (RPPIFIRRL) tetramer.\\nCD8 T cells from acute multiple sclerosis patients display selective increase of adhesiveness in brain venules: a critical role for P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 L.\\nOur results show that CD8, but not CD4, T cells from MS patients in the acute phase display increased ability to be recruited in inflamed brain venules.\\nMethods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from 14 stable relapsing-remitting MS patients, 6 relapsing MS patients, 13 IFNbeta-1a (8) or IFNbeta-1b (5) treated MS patients, 6 patients affected from Other Inflammatory Neurological Diseases, and 11 healthy controls.\\nDopamine inhibited T cell proliferation, MMP-9 expression, and enhanced T1/Th2 cytokines mRNA in PBMCs from HD but not from MS patients.\\nFor this reason, they have been implicated as contributors to inflammatory diseases, and depletion of gamma-delta T cells in mice delays or protects against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis (MS).\\nGiven the recent data that support a protective effect of VitD intake on the risk of developing MS (Munger, K.L. et al., Neurology, 2004; 62: 60) , our results suggest that effects of VitD on reducing the proinflammatory activity of gamma-delta T cells may contribute to this effect.\\nIncreased T cell and antibody reactivity can be detected in these patients against several antigens that are present predominantly, but not exclusively, in both the spinal cord and the thyroid gland.\\nCapocchi University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy Aim: This study was aimed to assess the expression of K+ channel Kv1.3 mRNA levels by CD4+ cells in patients with relapsing-remitting (R-R) multiple sclerosis.\\nResults: RT-PCR analysis showed a higher expression of the KTv1.3 band in CD4+ Tcells of MS patients, particularly during relapses, than in healthy controls.\\nOur results demonstrate that pDCs derived from MS patients have an altered regulatory function compared to controls that may have an influence on immune imbalance in MS.\\nThe aim of this study was to assess the differences in gene expression levels for a set of eight immune system genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients with MS.\\nWe assessed the gene expression levels of HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, IFN-gamma, IL4, TNF-alpha, IDO, soluble CTLA4 and full length CTLA4 in PBMCs from 20 MS patients and 20 healthy controls by realtime PCR.\\nWe measured cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and their tissue inhibitor TIMP-1 by Activity Assay System ELISA, respectively, in 37 relapsing-remitting (RR), 15 secondary progressive (SP) and 9 primary progressive (PP) multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, stratified according to clinical and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) evidence of disease activity, and in 96 patients with other inflammatory neurological disorders (OIND) and noninflammatory neurological disorders (NIND).\\nWe have amplified by NPA-PCR and/or Valpha-or Vbeta-specific PCR alpha-and beta-chain TCR transcripts of T cells infiltrating acutely demyelinating brain lesions of four patients with chronic progressive MS who died within 2 to 8 years after clinical diagnosis.\\nThese results demonstrate the presence of oligoclonal populations of T cells in brain plaques from these patients with chronic progressive MS, comprised of a few numbers of expanded T-cell clones.\\nThe present study describes in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, the natural history of new brain lesions visualized with Gd enhanced (Gd+) MRI scans by two different Gd dosages.\\nMaterials and methods: We measured tau protein and beta-amyloid42 concentrations in CSF in patients with MS and control group of patients and the results were statistical analysed.\\nResults: Compared with control data-the allele prevalencies in the general UK population-our patients had increased frequencies of HLA A2 (100% versus 24.1%,), HLA B44 (66.7% versus 10.3%), HLA DR4 (83.3% versus 12.8%), and HLA DQ8 (66.7% versus 5%).\\nFurther studies will establish whether HLA typing can help identify those adults presenting with focal epilepsy who are at risk of progressing to severe chronic focal autoimmune encephalitis and who may benefit from immune therapy.\\nIn the present study, we sought to determine if the composition of inflammatory cells in patients with paraneoplastic encephalitis (PE) and nonparaneoplastic limbic encephalitis (NPLE), two other chronic encephalitic conditions that have been suggested to be T cell mediated disorders, are similar to that in RE.\\nKnudsen and C.A. Vedeler Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are often associated with specific onconeural antibodies, but the pathogenic importance of the humoral immune response is unclear.\\nIn order to clarify this problem, we treated mice with corticosterone (a potent suppressor of inflammation) and characterized its effect on seizures and their associated neurological and neuroimmune consequences (in the well-established model of pilocarpine administration in mice) using in situ hybridisation, immunocytochemisty and various markers of cell death and damage.\\nGfkyigit a a Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey; b University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA In order to detect antibodies against central nervous system (CNS) antigens in 12 patients with seizures and primary or secondary antiphospholipid (aPL) antibody syndrome, serum samples were tested by immunohistochemistry.\\nIn aPL syndrome patients, serum antibodies against CNS might have emerged due to certain antiepileptic drugs, disruption of blood-brain barrier by stroke or in certain cases, they might be playing a causal role.\\nStrong nuclear staining might simply be related to the anti-nuclear antibodies frequently detected in aPL syndrome or SLE patients, whereas cytoplasmic staining might be indicating the presence of CNS-specific antibodies developing either as an epiphenomenon during the course of disease or as a contributing factor to epilepsy.\\nBaykan a a Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul, Turkey; b University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX, USA Sera from 4 siblings (aged 24-31 years) with Lafora disease (LD) late onset variant, diagnosed by axillary skin biopsy, who also had high titers of anti-gliadin IgG antibodies were tested by immunohistochemistry for antibodies capable of binding to mouse central nervous system (CNS) antigens.\\nSince one patient from the same family with a similar clinical condition did not reveal detectable amounts of antibodies against CNS, it is more likely that these autoantibodies emerged as a by-product of the ongoing disease rather than being primary or causal factors.\\nMethylprednisolone treatment significantly increased RGC apoptosis during MOG-EAE and did not lead to a recovery of ERGs or VEPs. The underlying molecular mechanism of RGC death involved suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, which was calcium-dependent.\\nPLP-specific T cells directly contacted neurons in which they induced calcium oscillations finally resulting in a lethal increase in neuronal calcium levels.\\nThe effects were independent of antigen presentation since OVA-specific T cells were also able to induce an increase in neuronal calcium.\\nAn inappropriate cross-talk between activated T lymphocytes infiltrating the central nervous system (CNS) and neural cells can sustain the onset and progression of demyelination and axonal degeneration in neuroinflammatory diseases.\\nBlockade by specific antibodies of soluble Sema-4D/CD100 released by activated T cells, or treatment with recombinant sSema4D/CD100, demonstrated that this immune semaphorin has the ability to collapse oligodendrocyte process extensions and to trigger neural cell apoptosis, likely through receptors of the plexin family.\\nThe specific presence of sSema4D/CD100 in the CSF and of Sema4D/CD100 expressing-T lymphocytes in the spinal cord of patients suffering with neuroinflammatory demyelination pointed out to the potential pathological effect of sSema4D/CD100 in the CNS.\\nThus, our results show that Sema4D/CD100 is a new important element in the deleterious T cellneural cell crosstalk during neuroinflammation and suggest its role in demyelination or absence of remyelination in neuroinflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis and HTLV-1-associated myelopathy.\\nTreatment of human and mouse neuronal cell lines with recombinant IL-1beta or TNF-alpha increased PAR-2 mRNA and protein levels ( Pb0.05).\\nThese studies indicate that PAR-2 exerts a neuroprotective effect against lentivirus-induced brain disease that is augmented by pro-inflammatory cytokines.\\nWe investigated whether LTAFMDP (muramyl dipeptide) could activate rat cortical glial cells (astrocytes and/or microglia) by measuring IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and nitric oxide (NO) production that subsequently could induce neuronal cell death and if so by what mechanisms.\\nIndeed LTA in synergy with MDP (active principle of peptidoglycan) induced strong inflammatory response of both types of glial cells as time-and dose-dependent production of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and NO was observed.\\nLack of in situ proliferation of T cells expressing high levels of Bcl-2 in the CNS and the paucity of apoptosis are likely responsible for the accumulation of these T cells in the CNS during late chronic demyelinating disease in SJL mice.\\nBy using real time PCR, the expression of ligands for the stimulatory receptor NKG2D as well as ligands for NK cell inhibitory receptors in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were analyzed in vivo, after a peripheral nerve lesion, and in vitro, in DRG neuronal cultures exposed to interferon (IFN)-gamma or LPS, or infected with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) or a neurotropic influenza A virus strain, WSN/33.\\nResults from fluorescence staining with propidium iodide, calcium imaging, Western Blot and RT-PCR analysis showed that QA stimulates NMDAR primary cerebellar granule neurons but not microglia; inducing an increased Ca2+ influx and activation of the extracellular signal regulated kinase, and consequently cell death.\\nThese results indicate that TNF-induced hOLs death depends critically on AIF activation and might have significant importance in designing new molecules to protect hOLs in multiple sclerosis.\\n10/19 myelin reactive T-cell lines/clones (TCL) from eight multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 5/11 TCL from five healthy controls (HC) produced LIF upon stimulation.\\nWe analyzed pro-(Bax, Cyt-c, APAF-1) and anti-(Bcl-2) apoptotic proteins in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) cytosol and mitochondria membranes during GA treatment in relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients.\\nWe hypothesize that the severity and the progression of the cerebral injury resulting from HSE can be evaluated by quantitative measurement of different compartments of immune activation molecules, such as soluble Fas (sFas), a molecule involved in apoptosis.\\nWe have previously reported that autoimmune inflammatory disorders are associated with altered levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), that immune cells produce NGF and express NGF-receptors (NGF-R), and prospected the hypothesis that these two NGF markers should be considered as signals for cell-to-cell recognition in immune systems.\\nThe results showed the presence of NGF and of NGF-R in thymic epithelial cells and in mast cells of control subjects, and an altered expression of these NGF markers, both at protein and gene expression levels, in the MG thymuses.\\nDeLeo Anesthesiology/Pharmacology, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, USA Recent evidence suggests that activation of intrinsic inflammatory immune responses in the CNS contribute to the development and maintenance of behavioral sensitization.\\nIn this study, we examined the pattern of glial activation and proinflammatory cytokine expression at the lumbar spinal cord in a rat model of neuropathic and chronic inflammatory pain.\\nGene expression, studied by real-time RT-PCR, for glial markers (GFAP and S100B for astrocytes, and Mac-1, TLR4 and CD14 for microglia), and prinflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha) showed a differential upregulation following nerve injury or inflammation.\\nMartin a a National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA; b Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA High-dose immunosuppressive therapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has shown strikingly beneficial effects on the disease course in a subset of patients with severe autoimmune diseases.\\nWe studied seven patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) after HSCT who had no toxicities or infectious adverse events and no signs of residual inflammatory disease activity during follow-up.\\nT cell receptor excision circle analysis confirmed that the output of thymus-derived naRve CD4+ T cells after immune reconstitution substantially increased, reaching levels comparable to healthy age-matched controls.\\nBased on studies on experimental models of autoimmunity, intense immunosuppression followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been recently proposed as treatment for rapidly progressing multiple sclerosis (MS) unresponsive to conventional therapies.\\nHere we report the MRI and clinical follow up of 19 rapidly worsening MS patients with a high number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions at T0, treated with cyclophosphamide 4 g/m 2 as mobilizing regimen and BEAM (BCNU, Cytosine-Arabinoside Etoposide and Melphalan) as conditioning treatment.\\nThe present results demonstrate that intense immunosuppression followed by ASCT has an effect on inflammation detected by MRI not comparable to any other currently available therapy, may successfully stabilize disease course and thus should be considered as therapeutic option for those MS subjects with poor prognostic factors not responding to conventional therapies.\\nAnti-ergotypic T cell responses in healthy controls and multiple sclerosis patients N.\\nPeripheral regulatory mechanisms may prevent the expansion of autoreactive T-cells that play a role in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS).\\nThis study aims to further characterize anti-ergotypic T-cells in MS patients and healthy controls (HC).\\nWhile there were no significant clinical changes over the course of this short trial, subjects who had T cell responses to the trivalent TCR peptide vaccine showed a trend towards reduced MRI activity.\\nOur results indicate that atorvastatin regulates T cell expansion via an induction of anergy and portray a novel immunomodulatory function of HMG-CoAR inhibitors in the treatment of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.\\nKarandikar UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system with features suggestive of T-cell-mediated autoimmunity.\\nThese results demonstrate that a few dominant clones of CD8+ T-cells contribute to the GA-induced response and may mediate its immunomodulatory effect through direct cytotoxic killing of relevant immune populations.\\nEffect of Rituximab on the peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid B cells in patients with primary progressive multiple sclerosis N.\\nObjective: To determine what effect Rituximab has on the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) B cell population in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), a chronic inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the CNS that likely involves an autoimmune mechanism.\\nConclusion: The effect(s) of Rituximab on the CSF B cell compartment are limited in comparison to the periphery, but will need to be confirmed in a larger group of MS patients.\\nWe have recently shown that a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-2 receptor alpha chain, Daclizumab, substantially reduces brain inflammation in MS patients with incomplete response to standard interferon beta therapy.\\nWe prospectively analyzed the functional status of lymphocytes in patients before and during therapy with Daclizumab by evaluating surface expression of activation markers, chemokine receptors and cytokine chains, and by employing CFSE-based proliferation assay.\\nResults: Statins exhibit dose-dependant antiproliferative effect in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).\\nIn addition to the effect on antigen presentation, simvastatin decreased surface expression of activation markers (CD25, CD69), memory and naRve subset markers (CD45RO, CD45RA), and chemokine receptor (CCR5) on the effector CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes.\\nWe have proposed a new hypothesis that chronic autoimmune diseases occur in individuals genetically susceptible to the effects of B-cell infection by EBV, with a resultant increase in the frequency of EBV-infected autoreactive B cells, which not only produce autoantibodies but also inhibit activation-induced apoptosis of autoreactive T cells in the target organ [Trends Immunol.\\nThis study aims to determine whether MS patients have an increased frequency of EBV-infected immortalized autoreactive B cells leading to the development of MS.\\nIn addition to detecting EBV DNA in PBMCs of MS patients, we have found that, compared to healthy subjects and patients with other neurological diseases, MS patients have higher levels of circulating antibodies to two overlapping peptides of myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), namely PLP184-199 and PLP190-209, and increased levels of opsonizing antimyelin antibodies.\\nOne MS patient with high circulating levels of opsonizing antimyelin antibodies and severe progressive spinal cord involvement refractory to intravenous methylprednisolone and glatiramer acetate improved following B cell depletion by rituximab.\\ncoli dnaJ were able to induce an increased expression of CD69 ( pb0.04) or T cell proliferation ( pb0.02) compared to the control peptide.\\nInfluence of estriol therapy on inflammatory responses on brain endothelial cell tight junction molecules in multiple sclerosis I.V. Korzh, I.F. Fedotova and V.D. Nemtsova Kharkov Medical University, Kharkov, Ukraine\\nTo elucidate mechanisms of endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction in CNS inflammatory responses and beneficial effects of oral estriol therapy in multiple sclerosis (MS), we analyzed effects of individual and combinations of soluble inflammatory mediators on the intracellular localization of the EC tight junction-associated molecules zonula occludens-1 and -2 (ZO-1 and ZO-2) in human brain ECs. The cytoplasm in the majority of cells in control EC cultures was clear; ZO-1 and ZO-2 were localized peripherally near sites of cell contact and associated with submembranous cytoplasmic filaments.\\nThese findings suggest that in MS patients, estriol treatment may counteract inflammatory mediator effects on CNS EC tight junction molecules, thereby preserving EC barrier function.\\nThe therapeutic effect of IFN-beta could be due to restoration of immunoregulatory mechanisms that are defective in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients such as regulatory NKT cell/CD1d pathway.\\nDesign: NKT cells percentages in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and secretion of cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and TGF-beta) by NKT cells stimulated with their model antigen agalactosylceramide were measured in RR MS patients before and after treatment with IFN-b1a.\\nResults: Our preliminary data showed that percentages of NKT cells are reduced in MS patients prior to IFN-b1a treatment compared to controls.\\nTo evaluate differences in IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 expression in MS patients treated with different IFN-beta molecules we quantified IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 mRNA by real-time RT-PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\\nA nonparametric test showed significant decrease in patients treated with IFNbeta compared to patients without treatment and healthy controls in both IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 expression.\\nAutoimmune T cells are kept in the periphery under tight control of naturally occurring regulatory T cells and a mechanism underlying an ability to evoke autoimmune response to CNS injury without developing an autoimmune disease is largely unknown.\\nIn this study we show that certain neurotransmitters, increased after CNS injury, can preferentially act on naturally occurring CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells through a specific receptors, expressed by these cells, and alleviate their inhibitory activity.\\nSince these Treg cells are believed to control auto-reactivity, experiments were performed to determine whether CD4+CD25high Treg cells isolated from the peripheral blood of patients with multiple sclerosis exhibited alterations in frequency or function as compared to those from healthy controls.\\nFunctional analysis of non-activated CD4+CD25high cells expressing only high levels of CD62L demonstrated an even greater functional disparity between patients and controls.\\nThese results suggest that regulation of autoreactive T cell responses is not only tissue-specific, but that the CNS actively exerts differential regulation of CD4+ versus CD8+ T cells.\\nSince activation of circulating self-reactive T cells with specificity for myelin components is considered to be an important disease initiating event, effective immunoregulation of peripheral T cells may be critical to prevent autoimmunity within the CNS.\\nWe assessed prevalence and suppressor function of Treg isolated from peripheral blood of patients with clinically active relapsing-remitting MS and healthy controls using flow cytometry, gene expression analysis, and in vitro proliferation assays.\\nWe demonstrate that the suppressive potency of patient-derived Treg is impaired, as their inhibitory effect on allogeneic and polyclonal T cell proliferative responses as well as on antigen specific T cell proliferation induced by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein is significantly reduced compared to Treg from controls.\\nThis result is mimicked using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from controls, variably depleted ex vivo of T lymphocytes, suggesting the involvement of lymphopenia-driven HP.\\nVariation in responses between patients, and the differential effect of IL-7 on various T cell subsets may predispose to the development of new autoimmune phenomenon.\\nDuring autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) as occurs in multiple sclerosis (MS), self reactive immune response is compartmentalized, and oligoclonal expansion of B cells has been observed.\\nIn order to assess whether clonal composition of ex vivo unstimulated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) T-cells might be related to pathogenic potential, molecular analysis of T-cell receptor (TCR) Vh transcripts of 46 functionally rearranged genes and global comparison of the complementarity-determining region 3 length distribution (CDR3-LD), was carried out ex vivo, contemporarily in unstimulated CSF cells and PBMCs. The method, consisting in a twostep Multiplex RT-PCR, allowed expansion of the whole TCR Vh gene repertoire from as few as 10(5) cells, indicating that it was sensitive enough to evaluate CSF T cells.\\nOur data indicate that likely disease-relevant CSF-infiltrating T cells recognize a much broader range of antigens within MS brain tissue than previously anticipated.\\nConclusions: Our results support the prevalent hypothesis regarding mechanisms of action of statins: intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway downstream of HMG-CoA promote isoprenylation, i.e. post-translational lipid attachment of intracellular proteins that regulate the activation of lymphocytes.\\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease thought to be mediated by T cells recognizing myelin protein peptides.\\nIn agreement with other studies, we did not observe any difference in the amount of blood circulating CD25À high CD4+ cells in patients with either chronic or remitting-relapsing MS in comparison to normal donors.\\nSelective elevation in the CSF compartment of MS patients therefore suggests a role of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells in the development of autoimmune CNS demyelination.\\nMartin a a National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, USA; b Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, San Diego, USA; c University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Piscataway, USA Degenerate antigen recognition by T cells may contribute significantly to autoimmunity through activation of auto-reactive T cells via molecular mimicry and the subsequent development of disease.\\nScreening of positional scanning combinatorial peptide libraries (PSCL) and an MS brain cDNA expression library with a MBP83-99 specific HLA-DR2a-restricted T cell clone have identified numerous infectious/foreign proteins as well as ubiquitous autoantigens as ligands.\\nWe have previously demonstrated that IL-12p40 monokines are also critical for the development of relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of multiple sclerosis that is mediated by myelin-specific Th1 cells.\\nEndogenous Treg appear to infiltrate the CNS during peak EAE and to persist at high levels during remissions as indicated by the upregulation of Foxp3, a Treg-specific transcription factor, in spinal cords of sensitized mice.\\nCompared to control encephalitogenic cells, the cannabinoid reduced IFN gamma production and increased the concentration of IL-10, suggesting a shift towards the Th2 profile.\\nTaking into account the crucial role played by the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) in the control of key genes involved in activation and differentiation of autoreactive T cells in vivo, we also investigated possible effects of the cannabinoid on activation of this nuclear factor.\\nThese results suggest that nuclear receptor agonists modulate JAK-STAT signaling pathway in T cells and be useful in the treatment of MS and other Th1 cell mediated autoimmune diseases.\\nRecent studies using central nervous system antigen (CNS) specific T cell lines engineered to express green fluorescent protein (GFP) have demonstrated that cell activation is crucial in determining disease severity.\\nIn adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis differences in activation levels of infiltrated T cells are antigen specific and determine their ability to recruit macrophages, explaining why some T cell lines are weakly pathogenic (S100beta) while others are strongly pathogenic (myelin basic protein).\\nAnalysis of autoantigen-specific CD3zetaGFP T cells after adoptive transfer reveals that immune synapses can be visualised in the CNS, enabling the identification of antigen-presenting cells in experimental autoimmune disease models.\\nThe aim of this study was to determine the expression of cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors in joints of arthritic mice treated with VIP, as well as to check the immune response against CII of cells from treated mice.\\nChronic progression of relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (R-EAE) in the SJL mouse is dependent on the activation of T cells to endogenous myelin epitopes, i.e. epitope spreading which plays a major pathologic role in disease progression.\\nUsing transfer of naive CFSE-labeled TCR transgenic T cells and mixed bone marrow chimeras, we show that activation of naive PLP139-151-specific T cells in SJL mice undergoing PLP178-191-induced R-EAE occurs directly in the CNS and not in the cervical lymph nodes, spleen or other peripheral lymphoid organs.\\nFunctional examination of the antigen presentation capacity of APC populations purified from the CNS of mice with established PLP178-191-induced R-EAE shows that only F4/80-CD11c+CD45hi DCs efficiently present endogenous antigen resulting in the activation of naive PLP139-151-specific Tg T cells.\\nAlthough myelin-specific Th1 cells are able to induce EAE in unimmunized mice, studies in both MS and EAE suggest that B cells and antibodies may play a role in demyelination.\\nHowever, over 60 % of 2D2xTh mice, which express both MOG-specific T and B cells, developed a very early and severe form of EAE.\\nInterestingly, although these regimens result in EAE with similar anti-MOG antibody titers as evaluated by ELISA, only human MOG requires B cells for disease induction.\\nThese data suggest a novel mechanism for antibody pathogenicity in B cell mediated EAE, and provide in vitro tools to determine whether an autoimmune antibody is pathogenic, and may be useful for evaluating the pathogenicity of antibodies in MS patients as an adjunct to diagnosis and treatment.\\nSimilar to that which has been observed in RA, in the murine collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model of RA we have identified serum antibody reactivity specific for citrulline-modified proteins that precedes clinically apparent disease.\\nThese results demonstrate that antibodies specific to citrulline-modified proteins are pathogenic and likely play an important role in joint destruction in human RA.\\nThese data suggest that in SmD peptide immunized mice, a T to B cell epitope spreading was responsible for the generation of anti-A-RNP antibodies.\\nRecent studies suggest that increased T cell and autoantibody reactivity to lipids may be present in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients as compared to controls.\\nTo further characterize myelin autoantibodies in these diseases, we studied the humoral response to a panel of candidate autoantigens using protein arrays then confirmed these data using novel solid and solution phase antibody binding assays.\\nThrough Toll-like receptors (TLRs), the innate immune system has the ability to recognize pathogens or pathogenderived products and to initiate signaling cascades that trigger macrophages and dendritic cells to produce proinflammatory cytokines.\\nTherefore, manipulating the innate immune system through TLRs and the MyD-88 signaling pathway offers a unique opportunity to suppress destructive inflammatory responses and may provide a novel approach for the treatment of Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases.\\nWe now report that HSP60 in vitro differentially modulates the expression of Th1/ Th2 transcription factors in human T cells: HSP60 downregulates T-bet, and NFATp,  leading to decreased secretion of TNFa and IFNg and enhanced secretion of IL-10.\\nPatients with advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) exhibit profound defects in cell mediated immunity partially resulting from marked deficiencies in the numbers of peripheral blood dendritic cells (DCs) and in their capacity to make DC derived cytokines (IL-12, IL-15 and IFN-a).\\nBecause host immune function appears to play an integral role in mediating disease-controlling responses in CTCL, we investigated the effects of synthetic imidazoquinolines which have been recognized as immune stimulatory by virtue of activation of DCs following binding to Toll like receptor (TLR) 7 and 8.\\nTLR 7, 8 and 7/8 binding compounds were cultured with freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with advanced CTCL (erythroderma with circulating malignant T-cells) and normal volunteers and a broad panel of immune functions assessed.\\nThe cytokine inducing effects were associated with marked activation of NK and CD8 T-cells assessed by CD69 expression and cytolytic activity.\\nSuch pre-clinical findings have typically been associated with significant clinical improvement when put into clinical practice and therefore have important implications for the potential enhancement of anti-tumor immunity among patients with advanced CTCL.\\nRegulatory T (Treg) cells are now considered an essential part of the normal immune response and their absence or malfunction has been causally linked to disease in both animal models and clinical scenarios.\\nRecently, our group and others, have reported that Treg cells are numerically deficient in patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), a systemic autoimmune disease.\\nResults obtained from these series of experiments indicate that Ti-Tregs depend for their survival and expansion on the presence of an ongoing inflammatory response as indicated by the loss of FoxP3 expression and regulatory capacity in Ti-Tregs transferred in SCID mice in absence of colitogenic cells.\\nThe properties shown by Ti-Treg cells not only offer a new insight on how normally occurring immune responses can be physiologically controlled, but also offer the possibility to generate regulatory cells in vitro as a therapeutical tool circumventing the problem related to a prolonged and generalized state of immunodepression.\\nFoxP3 is a member of the forkhead / winged-helix family of transcriptional regulators that has been shown to play a key role in the development and function of CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells in mice.\\nWe have introduced the mutations identified in patients into the FOXP3 cDNA and expressed them exogenously in cells to assess their effects on FOXP3 nuclear import, dimerization, DNA-binding and transcriptional control.\\nMaterials and Methods: We investigated the effect of agonist anti-CD200R mAbs in three independent functional assays: on the generation of alloimmunity in primary MLCs; on the generation of allostimulatory dendritic cells (DCs) from bone marrow cells cultured in vitro in the presence of (IL-4+GM-CSF); and on induction of Treg in ConA activated thymocytes in vitro.\\nIn the second assay, bone marrow cells were cultured for 8 days with GMCSF and IL-4 with/without anti-CD200Rs, to generate DCs. DC maturation was induced overnight by LPS (1Ag/ml), and the mitomycin-c treated DCs were used to activate fresh splenocytes in MLC, or to induce Treg in splenocytes cultured for 48hrs with these DCs. T reg were also induced in ConA activated thymocytes cultured with anti-CD200R mAbs. Treg were assayed by FACS (for CD4 + CD25 + cells), using real-time PCR for FoxP3 expression, and by their ability to suppress CTL and cytokine production in a fresh primary MLC culture.\\nMHC class II gene function has been closely associated with regulation of T cell immunity although the mechanism of their control remains unknown.\\nIn order to assess whether such tolerance mechanism would implicate the regulatory pathway, and notably CD4+, CD25+ regulatory T cells (T-regs), we examined the effect of somatic transgenesis of donor class II IAb genes in the bone marrow of CBA mice (H-2k), on the survival of subsequent C57BL/6 (H-2b) heart grafts.\\nUpon activation in vitro, p53-/-T cells and macrophages produced significantly elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines.\\nThe innate immune response of p53-/-macrophages to lipopolysaccharides and interferon-y was also significantly enhanced, which was accompanied with increased levels of total and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1.\\nConclusion: These data demonstrate that Ro52 is a novel RING-finger dependent E3 ligase, which inhibits proliferation and promotes activation induced cell death.\\nSpecific monoclonal antibodies to CML28 and CML66 were developed and utilized to detect antigen expression in leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia tissue on western blot and immunohistochemistry.\\nThe expression patterns of CML28 and CML66 are similar to some other leukemia associated antigens, including the Wilms Tumor gene (WT1), and suggest that abundant expression in the malignant myeloid progenitor cell may be common to antigens that are targeted by the humoral immune response following DLI.\\nThe functional roles of these molecules in the inflammation-induced B cell expansion were then examined using the specific KO mice treated with DSS.\\nCurrent evidence suggests that MS results from autoimmune responses mediated by lymphocytes, which are activated in the peripheral lymphoid organs and migrate into the CNS.\\nRecent studies suggest that the transcription factor NF-nB, might play an important role in the development of chronic autoimmune attack in diseases such as MS.\\nImmunohistochemical studies confirmed the translocation of NF-nB p65 to the nucleus, and showed that, in most patient samples, the increased NF-nB activity was in T cells and monocytes rather than in B cells.\\nIn addition, the level of InBa protein was reduced in the cytoplasm of untreated MS patients compare to healthy controls, although not to a statistically significant degree.\\nThe results indicate that T cells and macrophages from untreated MS patients show higher levels of constitutively activated NF-nB than do healthy controls.\\nMethod and Result: Using a mouse heterotopic cardiac transplant model, mouse fg12 (mfgl2)/fibroleukin mRNA transcripts and protein were highly expressed in macrophages, CD4 and CD8 positive T lymphocytes and endothelial cells in rejecting cardiac allografts in association with deposits of fibrin.\\nWe have analyzed the cytokine production of CD4 + NKT cell clones derived from human PBMC of healthy subjects and multiple sclerosis patients, and found that exogenous IL-2 would promote their IL-5 production.\\nConclusion: Our data imply that, in the presence of IL-2, human CD4 + NKT cells could exhibit the potential to produce abundance of IL-5 in response to weak endogenous antigen stimulation, showing the interesting connection of IL-2 and the NKT cell-mediated immune regulation.\\nIn contrast, iNKT cells in the peripheral blood of all of our subjects (asthmatic, sarcoidosis and normal individuals) produced all three cytokines, suggesting the compartmentalization of Th2 subset of iNKT cells in the lungs of patients with bronchial asthma.\\nThese pulmonary CD4 + iNKT cells produce a cytokine profile known to amplify the inflammatory response in asthma strongly suggesting that iNKT cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of human asthma.\\nHere we examined the immunological function of TIM-1 using a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb), and demonstrated TIM-1 to be a potent T cell costimulatory molecule with a critical role in regulation of the immune system.\\nOur studies indicate that TIM-1 is a novel and significant costimulatory molecule, and altering TIM-1 function during the immune response could provide potent immunomodulatory therapies for a variety of immunological disorders.\\nConclusion: Our results demonstrate for the first time that presumably TCR driven peripheral homeostatic proliferation of naive CD4+ T-cells in healthy human individuals causes a significant contraction of the peripheral TCR repertoire.\\nGiven the importance of a highly diverse repertoire for the ability to mount efficient immune responses, this age-dependent deterioration of CD4+ T-cell immunity could entail ageing-associated increased susceptibility to infection or cancer and decreased efficiency of vaccination.\\nAll animals with clinical rejection (serum creatinin of 200AMol or higher) and that showed significant graft infiltrates expressed Foxp3 in the nucleus in 5 to 20% of lymphocytic cells.\\nImportantly, Sle1 breached tolerance in this model since B6.Sle1.HEL-Ig.sHEL mice had an increased number of B cells (18.66 F 3.791 Â10 6 vs 10.24 F 2.829 Â10 6 , p b 0.0006, n = 8-9, aged 3-6 months) and also had significantly higher levels of anti-HEL antibodies (39.70 F 5.643 U/ml vs 17.33 F 1.691 U/ml, n = 16-19 aged 3-7 months, P = 0.0013).\\nThe aim of this study was to determine whether INS-VNTR polymorphisms modulate functional phenotype of the T cell response to P-Ins in subjects with high risk DR4-haplotype, with (T1D patients and Ab+ subjects) or without (control subjects) betacell autoimmunity.\\nPatient-derived B cells were compared with normal controls by in vitro activation via BCR F BAFF.\\nResults: A 60 yr old patient with hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG 0,6g/l, IgA 5,3 g/l, IgM 0,6 g/l) and no family history of immunodeficiency was identified by FACS analysis to express no BAFF-R on B cells.\\nIn addition to being responsible for activation and release of inflammatory mediators by mast cells and basophils, allergenspecific IgE is able to form complexes with the allergen, which can be efficiently processed and presented by IgE-receptor expressing antigen presenting cells (APC).\\nBinding of both IgG1 and IgE was dependent upon the presence of both allergen and allergen-specific antibodies since incubation with sera from OVA-sensitized mice and an irrelevant allergen, or from naive mice and OVA did not result in a similar increase in antibody positive B-cells.\\nThe aim of this study was to apply the SAS technology to identify antigens that are specifically recognized by antibodies (IgG) present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients.\\nIn conclusion, our findings demonstrate that this novel molecular approach is useful to identify novel candidate antigens in MS that can be used as diagnostic markers, and can be used to study the humoral immune response in MS.\\nCMV specific CD8-T cells are maintained at a very high frequency in healthy CMV carriers, reflecting a permanent control of CMV reactivation at a subclinical level by the hosts immune response.\\nSpecific T cells were detectable at the time of reactivation as early as 34 days after allo-HSCT and underwent a phase of expansion with stabilization of the response depending on the intensity of antigenic challenge.\\nIn conclusion this study showed that a specific and effective anti-CMV response can be mounted very early after allo-HSCT, even if the donor was seronegative, and gave an insight into the evolution of CMV-specific T cell responses in human, from the onset of reactivation to the stage of chronic infection.\\nWe are working to establish flow based methods to assess the functional status of recipient cell in response to both non-specific and donor cell stimulation to ultimately tailor patient therapy.\\nCryopreserved PBMCs resulted in a considerably higher TNF production in response to most ligands than freshly isolated cells (31% mean increase amongst all ligands tested).\\nUsing optimized assay conditions, three patients with a mutation in the IKBKG gene encoding the NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) protein were ultimately studied as disease controls.\\nAlthough a number of variables influence TNF TLR responses this assay can be optimized for clinical use in screening for patients affected by primary immune deficiencies influencing TLR function.\\nAim of Study: Inhalation of innocuous proteins induces the development of tolerance, an immune response characterized by the development of T reg cells and absence of airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) or airway inflammation.\\nOur results define an antibody-independent therapeutic approach for the treatment of AlzheimerTs disease, utilizing compounds that have been safely tested or are currently in use in humans.\\nTreatment with a Donor-Specific Transfusion and Anti-CD154 mAb Induces Non-Responsiveness in a Population of T Cells That Recognize Alloantigen Via Indirect Antigen Presentation.\\n1 1 Medicine/Diabetes, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, Viet Nam. Treatment with a donor-specific transfusion (DST) and anti-CD154 monoclonal antibody (mAb) induces prolonged allograft survival in mice, in part by deleting host CD8 + T cells that recognize alloantigen by direct antigen presentation.\\nIn the present study, we compare the dendritic cell response to cellular necrosis in atopic individuals with non-atopic control subjects.\\nThe effect of SLAM on CD40L-induced DC activation was analyzed in co-cultures of DC with L929 cells expressing CD40L alone or in combination with SLAM.\\nResults: pDC, following engagement of TLR9, can activate autologous NK cells, as indicated by the induction of surface CD69 expression.\\nConclusions: This is the first demonstration in humans that pDC can activate NK cells, enhance their effector functions and induce proliferation.\\nHepatitis C Virus Core Protein Induced, Monocyte-Mediated Mechanisms of Reduced IFNA and Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Loss in Patients with Chronic HCV Infection.\\nLimited and controversial information is available related to the capacity HCV-infected patients to produce endogenous IFNa. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functional capacity of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs), the main producers of IFNa, in patients with chronic HCV infections compared to controls.\\nIn vitro stimulation with CpG-A DNA or HSV KOS lead to increased cell death in PDCs from HCV patients compared to controls (pb0.01).\\nPrevious data indicated that IL-10 treated human monocytes (MO) differentiate to macrophage (Mac) expressing elevated Mac markers like MRP8/4 while addition of IL-10 to monocytes after their partial differentiation to dendritic cells (MO IL-4 & GM-CSF 3 days then IL-10 added for additional 2 days) induces a tolerogenic dendritic cell (tol DC) which can diminish T cell activation.\\nTherefore, we investigated the impact of circulating PDCs measured at the 3rd month after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC, fludarabine-based conditioning) allo-SCT, in 54 patients with hematological and non-hematological malignancies who received a RIC-allo-SCT from an HLA-identical sibling, in order to determine whether this could provide an indicator for long term outcome.\\nPeripheral blood CD20+CD22+ B cells were within normal ranges by FACS, but showed profoundly reduced surface expression of CD19 in all three patients.\\nThis new approach allows fast and cost-effective high throughput analysis of T cell receptor rearrangement at the single cell level facilitating studies on T cell responses in human diseases.\\nThese findings indicate that immature myeloid DCs have the ability to induce granulomas under specific intestinal inflammatory conditions characterized by Th1 dominated immune responses (or absence of Th2 environment) and impaired B cell functions.\\nAlthough EAE, an animal model for MS, is considered a CD4+ T cell mediated disease, recent reports have suggested that myelin-specific CD8+ T cells can also cause EAE in susceptible strains of mice.\\nAmong these immortalized T cells, hybridoma 5/4E8 (specific for the consensus sequence of 73 GRVRVNSAY in human cartilage PG) induced arthritis upon adoptive transfer, which showed high similarities to the histopathology of the primary form of PG-induced arthritis (PGIA) and those described in peripheral joints of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\\nTo better understand the role of antigen-specific T cells in the development of this autoimmune model of arthritis, we have inserted the Va1.1 and Vh4 chains of the T cell receptor (TCR) of hybridoma 5/4E8 into an in vivo expression vector.\\nIn conclusion, the presence of the large number of arthritogenic epitope-specific T cells with high expression level of epitopespecific TCR is sufficient to induce arthritis.\\nTh1 cell activity plays prominent role in the multi-organ inflammation of sarcoidosis, but mechanistic study and therapeutic progress is hampered by the lack of an experimental animal model.\\nMoreover, the combination of anti-TIRC7 antibody with a TNF alpha receptor-fusion protein revealed additional therapeutic effects in established arthritis in mice.\\nMice treated with anti-TIRC7 mAb also showed a significant reduction of IgG1 anti-collagen antibody responses together with reduced B cell numbers.\\nConclusion: The treatment of autoimmune diseases such as RA associated with exaggerated T and B cell response with an anti-TIRC7 mAb might be unique as TIRC7 targeting results in modulation of both T and B cell response.\\nMoreover, unlike to other therapeutic pathways, anti-TIRC7 antibody therapy exhibits a significant inhibitory effect on memory T cell activation.\\nTIRC7 targeting could offer a novel therapeutic strategy for RA patients that synergizes with TNF alpha receptor therapy and the combination of TIRC7 signaling pathway with TNF alpha blockade might be important for the clinical use as a large group of non-responders to anti-TNF alpha targeting therapy is existing.\\nPD-1, a member of the B7/CD28 family of costimulatory molecules, is expressed on activated T and B cells and plays a role in regulating tolerance and autoimmunity.\\nRespiratory viruses such as influenza A elicit an immune response involving the activation, proliferation and recruitment of CD4 and CD8 T cells to the lung, the major site of viral infection.\\nIn the current study, we have determined how the inducible costimulatory molecule,(ICOS) regulates CD4 and CD8 T cell responses following influenza A infection.\\nSubstantial levels of ICOS were observed on CD4 and CD8 T cells during the acute influenza viral infection, which persisted for at least 30 days postinfection, subsiding gradually in a manner that paralleled the expression of IFN-g.\\nWe neutralized ICOS-ICOS ligand interactions during acute influenza viral infection of BALB/c mice using either recombinant ICOS-Ig fusion protein or neutralizing anti-ICOS mAbs. Although there was initially a delayed recruitment of CD4 T cells, this was followed by substantially increased number of CD4 T cells in the lungs.\\nMoreover, intracellular staining of these T cells demonstrated an elevated level of spontaneous production for both IFN-g and the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10 for up to 30 days post-influenza infection.\\nTogether, these results suggest a novel and previously unappreciated role for ICOS in negatively regulating both Th1 and regulatory cytokine production by T cells.\\nResults: In earlier studies we showed that donor-specific CD8 T cells are deleted from the peripheral repertoire within 10-14 days after BMT with this regimen.\\nManipulating the action of TIM-3, one of the members of this novel protein family, was previously found to profoundly affect disease severity and outcome in animal models of autoimmunity and allograft transplantation, and promote hyperproliferation of antigen-activated T cells and the spontaneous production of Th1 cytokines.\\nThese results strongly suggested that agents targeting TIM-3 pathways could also enhance effective anti-tumor immune responses in vivo, presumably through one or more mechanisms favoring Th1 cells and the promotion of cell-mediated immunity.\\nBy demonstrating a powerful capacity for TIM-3specific antibodies to change the course of tumor progression in treated mice, these experiments further support the prospective role of TIM-3 to act as a critical regulator of cell-mediated immune function and Th1 responsiveness.\\nWhen given daily via IP injection, from time of symptomatic onset, AEG35169 reduced clinical scores within 5 days and prevented further disease progression in 84% of animals, compared to control groups receiving random or scrambled oligonucleotides or saline, 90% of which showed continued disease or increased severity (n = 16).\\nAnti-XIAP treated animals showed evidence of considerably increased leukocyte apoptosis, with high numbers of TUNEL positive cells in the spinal cord.\\nAnalysis of tissues at 40 days after immunization indicated no or very limited inflammatory infiltrates in anti-XIAP protected animals, and correlates of disease such as chemokine expression in CNS were reduced in treated animals.\\nWe recently showed that VLA-1+ T cells at sites of chronic autoimmune inflammatory arthritis express a restricted and unique T cell receptor (TCR) Vh repertoire, suggesting they are responding to a unique set of auto-antigens in tissues.\\nAnti TNFa mAb (Infliximab, 5-50 Ag/ml) but not control immunoglobulins, neutralized TNFa during ex vivo mitogen (PHA or anti-CD3)-triggered activation of VLA-1-peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (MC) (PBMC) and significantly reduced the percentage of VLA-1+ TC in 8-12 day cultures (36.9 F -20.3% to 26.9 F 15.7% of the TC, n = 9, pb0.011), but did not affect the VLA-4+ subset.\\ncoli produced insoluble protein and prepared purified forms of monomer and tetramer HLA-A2 peptide complexes displaying either human eukaryotic transcription initiation factor 4-gamma (eIF4G; VLMTEDIKL), a self-protein found to be upregulated in HIV infected T cells or human tumor suppressor protein p53 (264; LLGRNSFEV), a self-protein that is widely expressed in many cancers.\\nWe then immunized groups of Balb/c mice (5/group) 3 times with 2-week intervals with either monomer or tetramer forms of immunogen and assayed mouse sera for polyclonal IgG antibody response reactive for HLA-peptide by competitive ELISA.\\nTo confirm the specificity of the polyclonal antipeptide-A2 response, we evaluated antibody from mice immunized with tetramer immunogen to stain T2 cells (HLA-A0201 positive) pulsed with either eIF4G-or 264-peptide in a competitive binding assay.\\nOur T2 cell assay results support the ELISA data and indicate that immunogen formulated as a tetramer is immunogenic and able to generate anti-peptide-A2 specific antibody responses in mice.\\nFurthermore, we demonstrated by ELISA and T2 cell staining that tetramer forms of immunogen efficiently elicit IgG polyclonal antibody responses reactive against peptide-A2 within 4 weeks after initial immunization.\\nUtilizing a phosphorylation specific antibody we examined the expression of active nuclear NF-kB/RelA via immunohistochemistry in normal skin, non-lesional psoriatic skin, lesional psoriatic skin and lesional skin from patients treated with etanercept.\\nSerial biopsies from psoriasis patients treated with etanercept at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months demonstrated a significant down regulation of phosphorylated NF-kB/RelA which correlated with decreases in epidermal thickness, restoration of normal markers of keratinocyte differentiation, and clinical outcomes.\\nIn a cohort of patients with autoimmune uveitis being treated with multiple immunosuppressive medications, monotherapy with daclizumab, a humanized anti-Tac antibody, was sufficient to control their disease without serious side effects.\\nBackground and Objectives: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoreactive disease in which activated T cells play an important role orchestrating the autoimmune responses giving rise to the inflammatory cascade responsible for joint inflammation and bone destruction.\\nHere, we examine the effect abatacept administration has on disease induction, anti-collagen antibody production and bone destruction in a rat model of collagen induced arthritis.\\nAbatacept, the first of a new class of agents that selectively modulate the co-stimulatory signal required for full T-cell activation, was evaluated in vitro for its ability to regulate human T-cell proliferation and cytokine production.\\nThe effect of abatacept on antigen-dependent T-cell activation was evaluated using either an irradiated human B-cell line (PM-LCL) as the antigen-presenting cells (APCs) for a primary mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), or autologous E-PBMCs as APCs, for a recall response to tetanus toxin (TT).\\nConclusion: Abatacept, a selective co-stimulation modulator significantly inhibited the activation (as measured by cytokine production) and proliferation of human T cells in the context of a primary MLR or TT-dependent memory response.\\nThis inhibition occurred at concentrations below the serum C min levels observed in patients receiving a clinically effective dose of abatacept 1 (10 mg/kg monthly), consistent with suppression of T-cell activation in vivo.\\nThe LCMV isolate Clone 13 establishes a prolonged infection in Balb/c mice, which is associated with a less effective antiviral immune response and, in some studies, conditioning of dendritic cells.\\nThis was associated with a numeric increase of total spleen cells in comparison to non-treated mice and decreased levels of IL-10 were generated by such splenocytes.\\nConclusion: Our studies indicate that in persistent viral infections IL-10 plays an essential role in suppressing the anti-viral response and that systemic blockade can improve the clinical outcome.\\nEffects of Natalizumab (anti-VLA-4 Antibody) on Immune Cell Adhesion and Migration in Patients with MS.\\nObjective: (1) To establish biological dproof of conceptT that in vivo anti-VLA-4 treatment of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) results in decreased functional VLA-4 expression and migratory capacity of immune cells, and (2) Develop a simple in vitro assay that could be applied to monitor therapeutic response.\\nTo date, the impact of in vivo therapy with Natalizumab on the functional expression of VLA-4 on immune cells of MS patients has not been reported.\\nResults: We observed that expression of VLA-4 on circulating immune cells was significantly reduced after in vivo Natalizumab infusions (P = 0.004; n = 12).\\nConclusions: Our study provides the first biological dproof of conceptT that in vivo Natalizumab therapy results in diminished VLA-4 functional expression and migratory capacity of circulating immune cells.\\nBy combination of SPAQ with specific gasfilled microparticles (MP) targeted against VCAM and ICAM (VCAM-MP, ICAM-MP), we aimed to monitor the molecular changes at the blood-brain-barrier during the course of actively induced or adoptively transferred (AT) myelin basic protein (MBP)-EAE.\\nWe reported that (B6 Â SJL) F1 (H-2 b/s ) mice, with severe relapsing-remitting disease, had extensive infiltration by CD4+ T cells compared to C57BL/6 (B6) (H-2 b ) mice, which developed mild low-relapsing disease in response to myelin oligodendrocyte peptide ).\\nIn this report we show that the CD4+ cell chemoattractant cytokine IL-16, has an important role in regulation of relapsing EAE induced by MOG 35-55 in the (B6 Â SJL) F1, (H-2 b/s ) mice.\\nVarious alpha (v) integrins are expressed by monocytes, macrophages and DCs, and have been shown by antibody blockade to regulate monocyte transmigration and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages and DCs. However definitive in vivo studies of the role of alpha (v) in the immune system have been limited by the lethality of alpha (v) knockout mice.\\nIn the UK and the USA, peanuts are a common cause of food allergy, associated usually with high titer IgE antibody and consistent with the preferential activation of T helper (Th) 2 type cells.\\nUsing high IgE responder BALB/c strain mice, we have previously shown that sensitization with peanut lectin (a minor peanut allergen) is associated with an increase in allergenspecific IgE and changes in cytokine protein and mRNA expression indicative of a selective Th2 type response, with elevated levels of IL-4, but not IFN-g, cytokine expression.\\nMoreover, allergen-specific CD4 cells expressed a Th2 profile with increased frequencies of IL-4 (6.3%) and IL-10 (5.9%) and relatively low levels of IFN-g (0.9%) positive cells compare with unstimulated controls or with cells cultured with con A, after 96 hrs in culture.\\nWe found that antigen specific stimulation of naRve peripheral CD4+CD25-T cells from TGFh Tg mice induces Foxp3-expressing Th3 cells that are hyporesponsive and that have potent suppressive activities in vitro and in vivo.\\nIn a MOG peptide TCR Tg adoptive transfer model, Th3 cells from TGFh Tg mice not only prevented the generation of pathogenic Th1 cells in wild type animals before the induction of EAE, but also greatly inhibited the effector functions if transferred at the time of disease onset.\\nPreviously, we showed that treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Atorvastatin (AT) prevented the Th1 differentiation of myelin-reactive T cells and ameliorated clinical symptoms in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Youssef et al., Nature 420: 78, 2002) .\\nAs interleukin-4 (IL-4) is a most critical determinant in regulating immune responses by promoting Th2 cell development and inhibiting Th1 cell differentiation, we analyzed the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the IL-4 receptor a-chain, which is critical for binding of IL-4 and for IL-4 signal transduction, in the differentiation of human T cells.\\nTherefore, we utilized subunit-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies or genetic knockout mice to distinguish the individual contributions of IL-12, IL-23, and IL-27 in established murine models of Th1 autoimmunity and pathogen responses, namely experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and Leishmania major infection.\\nAnti-IL-23 suppressed central nervous system inflammation and pathology even though antigen-specific proliferation and cytokine re-stimulation responses were not influenced by in vivo antibody treatment.\\nObjective: Development of arthritis in the K/BxN mouse model is dependent on the induction of very high titers of antibodies (Abs) against the glycolytic enzyme glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, or GPI, promoted by CD4+ T cells expressing a transgeneencoded T cell receptor (TCR) specific for GPI.\\nThe answer to this question might generate important insights into human arthritides, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), associated with the production of autoAbs. Methods: The roles of cytokines known to control Th phenotype were investigated by introducing the interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-12p35 knockout mutations into the K/BxN model, and evaluating the impact of these deficiencies on clinical arthritis, autoAb production and T cell activation.\\nThe IL-4expressing cell-types in KBxN mice were revealed by crossing in a knock-in alteration resulting in green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression controlled by endogenous IL-4 gene regulatory elements.\\nIn this study we have analyzed the prevalence of GAD65-and proinsulin-specific CD4+ T-cells in type 1 diabetic patients, prediabetic subjects (positive for two or more autoantibodies) and in HLA-genotype matched islet-cell autoantibody (ICA) negative healthy children.\\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells, from DRB1*0401, 0404 or 0301 positive children in these three study groups, were cultured in the presence of two different GAD65 peptides (557I; aa 555-567 and aa 274-286) or with a proinsulin (aa 24-36) peptide for 10-11 days.\\nOur results show that 11 of 18 (61%) type 1 diabetic patients and 7 of the 20 (35%) prediabetic subjects were positive for one of the GAD65 or proinsulin-containing tetramers, whereas only 3 of 23 (13%) ICA negative healthy controls had tetramer binding cells.\\nThe frequency of tetramer positive cells in the GAD65 or proinsulin activated CD4high/CD25+ cells was higher in type 1 diabetic patients (0.00-9.19% ) and in prediabetic subjects (0.00-53.60%) than in control subjects (0.00-2.84%) (P = 0.01 and P = 0.03 for respectively study group, Mann-Whitney U-test).\\nIn conclusion, type 1 diabetic patients and prediabetic subjects have a higher prevalence of GAD65-and proinsulin-specific CD4+ T-cells than HLA-genotype matched healthy controls.\\nThe prevalence rates for allergen groups were: pollens (92.4%), mites (22.7%) and moulds (8.3% Mast cells play pivotal roles in immediate-type and inflammatory allergic reactions that can result in asthma.\\nCross-linking of the high-affinity receptor for IgE (FcRI) on mast cells activates a signaling pathway leading to Ca 2+ mobilization and is followed by degranulation and the release of histamine and other preformed mediators, as well as de novo synthesis of the arachidonic acid metabolites i.e leukotrienes, and prostaglandins.\\nTo investigate possible effects of heat shock on immunologic functions of bone marorow derived mast cells (BMMC), we studied degranulation and leukotrien production.\\nConclusion: TGF h-1 may up regulate the production of IFN-g by resting and stimulated PBMC in normal controls and asthmatics and this response was abrogated by specific antibody to TGF h-1.\\nBackground: The phenotype of CD4+ T cells accumulated in chronically inflamed tissue, in allergic process, have been found to be mainly CD4+ memory T cells that express surface markers associated with IL-4 production.\\nConclusion: Although CD4+CD30+ T cells in peripheral blood have been observed in atopic dermatitis patients, in this work we identified similar cellular population in respiratory atopic diseases, and also CD57+ T cells, these cells seems to corresponds of CD4 T cells which expressing IL-4 under stimuli.\\nIn allergic process a number of studies have analysed the phenotype of CD4+ T cells that express surface markers preferentially associated with IL-4 production.\\nIn conclusion the CD4 T house dust mite primed cells in allergic rhinitis patients expressing CCR3 that correlates with IL-4 production, these local challenge repercussion in peripheral CD4+ T cells could be observed only when those cells are stimulated with PMA-I.\\nMethods: DNA was extracted from cultures of B-cell lines of 26 ABPA and 29 non-ABPA patients and sequenced for IL-4Ra polymorphisms, including 1 extracellular (ile75val) and 4 cytoplasmic (glu400ala, cys431arg, ser503pro, and gln576arg) SNPs. IL-4 stimulated PBL from ABPA and control subjects were examined for the expression of CD23 on B cells by flow cytometry.\\nABPA subjects also had significantly increased expression of CD23 molecules per B cell of IL-4 stimulated PBL cultures compared to controls.\\nConclusions: Der p1 and Blot 5 are the major sensitizing allergens in this region, Blot 5 is a more potent one in HongKong, probably reflecting the high level of exposure to Bt. The unique major Bt and Dp allergens should be included for precise diagnosis and effective immuno-therapeutic treatment of mite allergy in HongKong.\\nConclusion: HDM-induced airway inflammation may include Der f-mediated release of inflammatory mediators, and the proteolytic activity of an allergen may stimulate the release of proinflammatory cytokines from human bronchial epithelium.\\n1000 CTLM caused a decrease in NHLF cell number relative to CM 1000 ( This study was performed to evaluate the probable effect of allergy in children with and without otitis media with effusion (OME).\\nTwo groups recently have reported that various mouse monoclonal IgE antibodies can induce mouse bone marrow derived mast cells to secrete mediators in the absence of known specific antigen.\\nIn this study, we investigated whether exposure to purified human myeloma IgE (catalog number A12162H, Biodesign International, Kennebunk, ME) in the absence of known specific antigen had detectable effects on the mediator secretion of human mast cells that were generated in vitro from umbilical cord blood cells.\\nHowever, under all conditions of challenge tested, chemokine production in response to IgE alone was significantly less than that induced when aliquots of the same IgEsensitized populations of human mast cells were stimulated by anti-IgE.\\nOverall, these results indicate that exposure to human myeloma IgE in vitro in the absence of known specific antigen can induce chemokine production by human mast cells at the concentrations tested.\\nWhile the clinical relevance of these findings remain to be determined, one might speculate that effects of IgE on mast cells that are independent of known specific antigen can contribute to the pathogenesis of mast cell-associated disorders, particularly in subjects with high levels of IgE.\\nInterestingly, ten days after the end of the treatment, in the rhinophototherapy group the allergen-induced wheal formation was significantly reduced compared to baseline (P = 0.03), in contrast in the fexofenadine treated group no differences were observed.\\nTo examine the effect of OMA in moderate-severe allergic asthma in patients using LTRAs, we evaluated asthma exacerbations and need for bursts of systemic steroids in a pooled analysis of two recently completed clinical trials.\\nResults: Patients on LTRAs tended to exhibit a greater level of asthma severity as evidenced by baseline history and trial incidence of clinical exacerbations, irrespective of treatment.\\nIn this study, we have shown that development of Th1/cell-mediated immune response significantly down-regulated Th2 responses by eliciting IFN-g production in experimental induced ova albumin (OVA) allergic BALB/c mice.\\nMoreover, spleen cells isolated from the chitin-treated mice showed abundant amounts of IFN-g production with the stimulation of chitin, and less amounts of Th2 cytokine with or without OVA-stimulation, suggesting that the inhibited Th2 responses might explain the potential mechanisms, due to the changes in antibody isotypes and cytokines produced from splenocytes of mice receiving chitin.\\nVarying amounts of drug concentration were added to specific cultures in order to study its differing effects on cell activation.\\nCD8+ overall activation level was unaffected with increasing treatment of drug and time, while 51 Cr assay suggested an overall decrease in NK cell activity.\\nWith increasing time and concentration, mean fluorescence for cells expressing the CD 69+ activation marker decreased.\\nAllergen immunotherapy is the only treatment for allergic rhinitis and asthma that can reverse the immune imbalance in patients with these IgE-mediated disorders.\\nCategory Potentially serious immune reactions or loss of treatment effect may result from repeated exposure of patients to therapeutic proteins or peptides even when they are from human sources or based on human sequences.\\nMaterials and Methods: The package inserts of twenty therapeutic human protein/peptide products were examined for the following information: alterations to peptide sequence or polysaccharide attachment, manufacturing process, choice of excipients, viral validation, assay of antibody development, in vitro or in vivo correlates of cell mediated immunity, precautions and contraindications in specific patient populations, therapeutic effect, and adverse reactions.\\n(2) Immunogenicity is most often studied for the development of serum antibodies to the therapeutic agent, but rarely in terms of cell-mediated immune responses or skinsensitizing antibodies, unless the route of administration is dermal application.\\nThe study was performed on 51 asthma patients with a positive history of dust allergy symptoms, positive skin prick test results with Dp extract and with a significant bronchoconstrictive response to bronchial Dp challenge.\\nThe fall in sIL-4r plasma concentration in DR seen at T EAR may result in increased activity of IL-4 which in turn may participate in the development of sustained allergic inflammation in these patients.\\nThe aim of the study was to compare the IL-4 and IL-4y2 expression ratio in patients with asthma versus healthy subjects.\\nEight healthy subjects and eight patients with atopic asthma confirmed by case history, skin tests and RAST were involved in the study.\\nThe major purpose of this study was: a) to compare the 3D structures of hIL-4y2 to the parent cytokine hIL-4; b) to attempt to reveal the dominant B epitope sequences in loop regions of hIL-4y2 using synthetic peptides and computer-assistant 3D modeling; c) to prepare monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific for each cytokine form; and d) to evaluate the binding affinities of the antibodies.\\nWe found that mice sensitized intraperitoneally with OVA with very low LPS content (removed with detoxigel; contained 50 pg/ml endotoxin) and rechallenged with OVA (Sigma, grade V; contained 190 ng/ml endotoxin), developed minimal allergic lung inflammation, mucus secretion, and OVA-specific IgE and IgG1, compared with animals immunized with high LPS containing OVA.\\nPatients are usually allergic to all the major milk proteins in cowTs milk or formulas, including caseins, betalactoglobulin, and alpha-lactalbumin and as a result develop dermatitis, asthma, or anaphylaxis.\\nThe advantages of milk as an allergen in experimental models is that it is natural and clinically relevant, broadens the scope and general applicability of mouse models of allergic asthma, induces an allergic response to a combination of proteins, and is cost effective (3 kg of milk powder in Vienna is 15.00 EUR; 50 g ovalbumin 900.00 EUR).\\nWe observed increased lung inflammation, mucus secretion, and milk-specific IgE and IgG1 at acute onset disease (day 31) and during relapses (day 90) in both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice.\\nSimilarly, mucus hypersecretion and milk-specific IgE and IgG1 levels were higher in C57BL/6 compared to BALB/c mice and all observed differences between strains were apparent in acute and relapse disease.\\nHere, we present a useful, inexpensive, and clinically relevant mouse model of milk allergy in C57BL/6 mice and demonstrate significant genetic differences in immune responses of C57BL/6 and BALB/c to cowTs milk.\\nAnti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy with omalizumab (OMA) is indicated in patients (z 12 years) with moderate to severe allergic asthma who continue to be inadequately controlled despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids.\\nMethods: Data were combined from 5 randomized double blind placebo-controlled (PBO) trials of patients with moderate to severe allergic asthma (confirmed by skin test or RAST testing); 4 were of 28 weeks and 1 was 32 weeks in duration.\\nThe pooled study population involved a total of 2236 patients (1136 treated with OMA, 1100 treated with PBO) who met entry criteria that included, at baseline, need for treatment with moderate to high dose inhaled corticosteroids.\\nPBO; primary endpoint) was determined using Poisson regression, controlling for age category, study, sex, baseline IgE, and prior history of asthma exacerbations for the overall population and for patients z50 years.\\nA similar approach was taken for evaluation of patient-and investigator-reported global treatment effectiveness (excellent, good, moderate, poor, worsening) using cumulative logistic regression for the two groups comparing OMA to PBO.\\nConclusions: In patients z50 years of age, omalizumab was associated with a RR reduction in clinically significant asthma exacerbations and significantly better patient-and investigatorreported global effectiveness ratings compared to placebo, suggesting that omalizumab is effective in older patients with moderate to severe allergic asthma.\\nMost importantly, after 5 days in culture with LTK-4A1, the number of CD19+/IL-13+ B cells was significantly higher (47.9% versus 17.1%) compared to the soluble anti-CD40 Ab. The production of IgE by human B lymphocytes cultured with LTK-4A1, as assessed by ELISA, also increased significantly (13.4 ng/ ml versus to 1.8 ng/ml) when compared to B cells stimulated with soluble anti-CD40 antibodies.\\nRationale Daclizumab (ZenapaxR), a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-2 receptor a chain (CD25), is approved for the prevention of renal allograft rejection and is under evaluation for treatment of asthma, multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.\\nDaclizumab inhibits activation of human T lymphocytes by blocking IL2-induced T cell proliferation, and by reducing production of Th2-and Th1-associated cytokines.\\nSince T Regs are characterized by the constitutive expression of high levels of CD25, we evaluated the in vitro effect of daclizumab on the function of these cells.\\nIn this study, we demonstrated the expression of effector function of intranasal primed Th cells in the lung following a challenge with antigen-bead emboli in C57BL6 mice.\\nUnderstanding the similarity and difference in the immune responses to groups of allergens will aid in the development of more effective allergy vaccines.\\nIn this study, we have exploited mice deficient in various aspects of antigen presentation to demonstrate the roles of both donor-and recipient-derived dendritic cells and proteasomes in the aquisition, processing, and crosspresentation of minor H antigens.\\nHaving shown that the neonatal phase is pivotal to induce dominant tolerance to peripheral antigens, we built up a syngeneic bone marrow transplantation model to determine whether development of regulatory T cells is restricted to a certain developmentally window.\\nWe have previously demonstrated that anti-host CTLs characteristic of acute GVHD in the B6-into-F1 model are impaired with selective blockade of either IL-2 or IFNg. Surprisingly, preliminary experiments indicated that at 14 days after donor transfer, mice receiving combined IL-2 and IFN-g blockade exhibited more severe lymphopenia than untreated acute GVHD suggesting a paradoxical worsening of disease when compared to selective blockade of either IL-2 or IFN-g alone.\\nOur results indicate that peak donor CD8+ T cell expansion (day 10) is 2-fold greater for GVHD mice receiving combined IFN-g and IL-2 blockade compared to untreated or control mAb treated WT GVHD mice.\\nIn animal models, delivery of apoptotic cells has been shown to regulate immune responses through the modulation of cytokines, generation of regulatory T cells, and downregulation of antigen-presenting cell (APC) function.\\nIn the present study, we demonstrate that the direct interaction of ECP-treated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with naRve human CD4 + T cells in vitro promotes a T cell phenotype with regulatory activity.\\nHowever, these regulatory T cells do not express increased levels of Foxp3 or IL-10, nor do they secrete significant levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IFNg, IL-4, and TNFa. Transfer of ECP-derived regulatory T cells to a secondary mixed lymphocyte reaction results in a greater than 50% inhibition of syngeneic responder T cell proliferation and IFNg production at a Treg:responder ratio of 1:20.\\nBACKGROUND Surprisingly, anti-tumor responses can occur in patients who reject donor grafts following nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplantation (Dey et al., Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 7:604) .\\nFollowing transfer of the allogeneic cells, the C57BL/6 hosts displayed progressive weight loss which was accompanied by increased production of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines detected in the serum, hepatic necrosis and inflammation in several organs.\\nConsistent with published studies, the recipients of WT B6 splenocytes alone (without BMC, so that the inoculum contained minimal numbers of hematopoietic stem cells) developed more severe GVHD compared to mice receiving a similar number of splenocytes from KO B6 donors (P b 0.05).\\nIn contrast, CTLA-4 blockade from day 21 onwards does not give rise to the breaking of transplantation tolerance, however, induces a lymphoproliferative syndrome with autoimmune manifestations.Our data suggest that after non-TCD allo miHC-disparate BMT, donor-host tolerance relies on clonal deletion which is insensitive to aCTLA-4 Ab. In contrast, tolerance to self is maintained by peripheral tolerance mechanisms, in which CTLA-4 signaling appears to play a major role.We are currently investigating if CTLA-4 blockade can elicit antileukemic reactivity and how the balance between autoimmunity and antitumor immunity can be modulated.\\nBecause allogeneic BMT has the potential to cure primary immunodeficiency diseases affecting marrow-derived cells, we consider that nonmyeloablative BMT is the treatment of choice for patients with WHIM syndrome who have an HLA-matched sibling donor.\\nTherefore, the purpose of the study was to establish the effect of sildenafil on NK cell activity in women with a history of RSA, including women with multiple in-vitro fertilization failures.\\nResults: We determined that there is a positive correlation between increased natural killer cell activity and PI in women with the history RSA compared to normal healthy women (r N 0.5, P b 0.05).\\nConclusions: Our data suggest that increased natural killer cell activity can be associated with diminished uterine artery blood flow.\\nObjective: High level serum IgE is the hallmark of immune response in allergic patients.\\nMethods: Animal model was developed by administration of allergens before mating for the study of the impact of maternal allergy on the development of an allergic immune response in early life.\\nThese studies identify key innate immune effectors that mediate poor pregnancy outcomes and provide novel and important targets for prevention of recurrent pregnancy loss in patients.\\nTherefore, we used the mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) reaction to compare the allogeneic T-cell response of non-pregnant women (n = 96) with the response of healthy pregnant (n = 68) and pregnant women affected by different gestation-associated diseases such as prolonged preterm rupture of fetal membranes (PPROM) (n = 20), uncontrollable preterm labor (PL) (n = 15), preeclampsia (n = 22) and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) (n = 12).\\nThe Changes of T Lymphocyte CD Markers in Patients Exposed to Mustard Gas. INTRODUCTION: The immunodepressive effects of mustard gas was detected in previous studies.The present study was performed on 31 Iranian chemical casualities, after 10 years of exposure to mustard gas, to determine the changes of absolute lymphocyte count and T cell CD markers compared to normal control group.\\nRESULTS: Absolute lymphocyte count were increased but lymphocyte CD2.CD3 and CD5 markers were decreased significantly (P b 0.05) compared to normal control group (The decrease in CD4 and CD8 markers were reported by other investigators previously).\\nNutritive values of plants decreases with the increase in the concentration of Cd metal which may be due to the absence of nitrifying bacteria which are normally found in symbiotic association with these plants where they fixes atmosphereic nitrogen in the roots of leguminous plants ( Dakora and Donald, 2002) but in the presence of Cd metal nodule formation was inhibited results in the decrease in the protiens contents and absence of amino acids at high concentrations of Cd. Potassium and sodium (Hsiao.T.C.,1986)were investigated and low percentages showed that accumalation of Cd was higher in the roots as compare to the other mineral ions due to which plants were not able to stand in the errect position.Iron Magnesium Magnese which were responsible for metabolic activity, transpiration and translocation were also effected and their percentages were also found to be decreased at higher concentration of Cd. Introduction: The mannan-binding lectin (MBL) pathway of innate immunity is important in host defense against pathogens.\\nMajor surgical trauma is known to influence various immune functions and in the present study we investigate the effect of major surgery on two central components of the MBL pathway; MBL and the associated protease MASP-2, compared with the effect on IL-6 and CRP levels.\\nCD70 antibody treatment however, had no effect on NKR expression by activated CD8 T cells at peripheral sites, where CD70+ APC do not occur.\\nThese results manifest the feasibility of data-driven construction of causal signaling network models from primary cell data at the single cell level and may have utility in understanding patient specific signaling alterations in disease states.\\nThese methods will permit rapid analysis of complex cell populations, including PBMCs. Interrogation of signaling pathways in individual cell types will allow more profound evaluation to gain additional insight into abnormalities causing or arising from the presence of immune dysfunction.\\nBacteriocin are low molecular weight single polypeptide or polypeptide complexes having an antibacterial activity, synthesized in ribosomes and secreted by bacterial cells or bthe group of heterogenous substances ranging from low molecular weight compounds to high molecular particles resembling bacteriophage protein components (Rasool & Khan, 1991) .Q In 1967 (Bradly) classified bacteriocins into two broad types: a) A group of low molecular weight, trypsin sensitive, thermostable bateriocin.\\nThe aim of our study is to test if the expression of FasL by DC can promote a stronger cytotoxic activity and a better anti-tumoral immunity compared with DC expressing a control Ag. We used the tymoma EL4 isolated from C57BL/6 mice and transfected with the cDNA encoding ovalbumin (EG7-OVA), the predominant Ag expressed by the tumor.\\nWe tested longitudinally sampled peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with melanoma, vaccinated with the differentiation antigen Melan/MART-1, for i) the presence of CD8aa expressing T-cells, ii) for T-cell differentiation and homing markers (CD45RA/CCR7) and iii) antigen-specific T-cells using AAGIGILTV (naturally processed peptide) and ELAGIGILTV (superagonist) peptides loaded into HLA-A2 tetramers.\\nIn vitro culture of PBLs from vaccinated patients with melanoma, using different cytokines and peptide stimulation, showed that IL7 or IL2 lead to a differential expansion of the CD8aa and CD8ab Melan/MART-1 specific T-cell population, respectively.\\nThe assesment of this memory T-cell population will be relevant for immunomonitoring of patients with tumors and aid to design improved tumor vaccines capable of stimulating long-lived cellular immune responses.\\nFurthermore, cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and cytokines gene expression were quantified at different times by real time PCR, in order to assess adipocytes response to one of the TLR ligand.\\nIntroduction: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a rare disease characterized by progressive necro-inflammatory hepatocyte injury caused by breakdown of immune tolerance to self-antigens however pathogenic mechanisms underlying the development of AIH are still unclear.The aim of our study was a complex analysis of autoimmune phenomena involving activation and apoptosis as well as transfer of co-stimulatory signals of particular lymphocytic subpopulations in peripheral blood of patients with AIH in different stages of immunosuppressive therapy.\\nResults: The percentage of T cells, Tc with surface marker CD95 was significantly lower in AIH de-novo diagnosed patients than in healthy subjects.\\nAfter 2 to 4 years of immunosuppressive therapy no significant differences in percentages of T, Th, Tc and NK cells were found between AIH patients and healthy subjects.\\n3. The percentage of activated B cells was increased in active phase of disease and significantly decreased following 5 months and 2-4 years of immunosuppressive therapy.\\nTo determine whether HMG CoA reductase inhibitor treatment has an effect on in vivo acute phase response and antibody production following tetanus vaccination in normal healthy volunteers in a double blind, parallel, placebo controlled study.\\nFollowing the ten-days of study drug or placebo, subjects in the atorvastatin group had a significant reduction in total cholesterol (AT: À44.4 F 9 mg/dL; PL: 22.7 F 8 mg/dL; P b 0.0001) and LDL cholesterol (AT: À46.2 F 9 mg/dl; PL: 13.2 F 7 mg/dl; P = 0.0001) compared to the control group, demonstrating the effectiveness of atorvastatin.\\nResults: Screening the antisera in the cell-based ELISA showed that all mice elicited specific antibodies against the plasmid-encoded Cpn10-HBsAg antigen.\\nKnown causes of angioedema were identified by clinical history with detailed information about personal and familial allergies; relationship of angioedema to potential causative agents were search (food, drugs, insect stings); complete physical examination, routine laboratory tests (blood cell count, protein electrophoresis, erythrosedimentation rate, stool for ova and parasites, pharyngeal and urine cultures, sinus and dental film, anti-tissue autoantibodies, rheumatoid factor), complement parameters (C1 inhibitor, C4, C1q) were performed.\\nResults According to our testing angioedema were classified as follow: related to external agents (drugs, insect stings, food) 209 (22.5%) (in particular 85 of them were related to treatment with an ACEinhibitor); associated to autoimmune diseases or infections 77 (8.2%); hereditary C1 inhibitor deficiency 183 (19.6%); acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency 14 (1.5%); idiopathic histaminergic 253 (27.2%), idiopathic non histaminergic 40 (4%).\\nThat combined MLIF and fibrin seal inhibited adhesions but either substance alone induced only a partial-and qualitatively different-reduction of adhesions suggests that these factors have different target mechanisms and act synergically, namely MLIF reducing activation signals from monocytes to fibroblasts, while fibrin seal modulating the Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the deficiency of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA).\\nIn our clinical studies, it has been observed that patients treated with rhGAA can seroconvert in response to the therapeutic protein.\\nThis approach may be effective in minimizing drug-specific antibody responses in patients receiving protein therapeutics.\\nTogether the functional analyses of creDKO thymocytes suggest that the decreased migratory activity of these cells might be related to decreased signaling resulting in increased cell death and consequent reduced thymocyte numbers.\\nFurthermore, the finding of significant increased proportion of effector T cells in the periphery of cre-DKO may be associated to the early onset of inflammatory bowel disease.\\nObjective of the study: IFN-g is a pro-inflammatory effector cytokine of cell-mediated immunity that plays an essential role in both innate and adaptive phases of an immune response.\\nStatistical analysis (Mann Whitney-U test and Spearman correlation coefficient) showed that there is no difference between the case and control groups regarding the number of mast cells and histamine concentration.\\nMultiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease mediated by T cells reactive to different antigenic peptides of the myelin sheath.\\nT cells re-directed against the antigen-specific T-lymphocytes that mediate immunopathology have been previously shown to be selective and effective as a targeted therapy of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Mekala et al.\\nTo develop humanized receptors capable of re-directing therapeutic T lymphocytes against potentially disease-causing cells, we linked the immunodominant epitope, 84-102, of the human myelin basic protein MBP to the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the HLA-DR2 beta chain (DRB1*1501) and the TCR-zeta cytoplasmic domain.\\nIn vivo studies in a humanized murine model system, validating the use of these modified T cells as a cellular immunotherapeutic agent capable of selecting targeting pathologic antigen-specific T cells, are ongoing.\\nThe blinded quantification of CD3 and Mac-3 positive cells revealed significantly lower numbers of T-cells and macrophages in the spinal cord of LIF -/-mice on day 60 p.i. These results were paralleled by a decrease of MCP-1 and GM-CSF mRNA levels in the spinal cord of LIF -/-mice on day 40 p.i. In summary, our results are in line with a defective antigen-specific T-cell priming and a selective defect in cytokine/chemokine production in LIF -/-mice.\\nBlood samples were taken from all mice before immunization, at the peak of the disease (day 11) and in partial remission (day 21), plasma protein concentration of 60 cytokines, chemokines and other markers was measured by Multi-Analyte Profile (MAP) testing.\\nIn previous studies we have shown that targeted DNA vaccines encoding selected proinflammatory mediators, particularly chemokines and cytokines, could effectively suppress experimentally induced autoimmune diseases in a selective manner.\\nHere we have investigated the regulation of activated pathogenic T cells in a spontaneously remitting model of autoimmune disease-experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).\\nIn conclusion, accumulation of CD4 + CD25 + Tregs (producing IL-10) in the CNS during the recovery phase of EAE suggests a role in the control of myelin-reactive pathogenic T cells.\\nIn the present study, we systematically analyzed cortical and white matter pathology in a large sample of multiple sclerosis brains with different disease courses (11 cases with acute MS, 6 with RRMS, 20 with SPMS and 14 with PPMS).\\nThe interaction between these two cell populations seems to play a role for immune regulation within the peripheral nerves since immunodeficient P0+-/RAGmice lack an age-related increase of CD34+ cells that parallels the occurrence of pathological changes within the peripheral nerves of P0+-mice.\\nIntroduction: Increasing evidence indicates that infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has a role in the pathogenesis of many human chronic autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS).\\nAims: This study aims to determine whether patients with MS have an increased frequency of EBV-infected immortalized B cells and defective immunity against latent EBV infection, which may lead to the development of MS.\\nFurthermore, our results from the IFN-gamma ELISPOT assays indicate a reduction in the T-cell response to MHC class-I-restricted latent EBV peptides in MS patients compared to healthy controls.\\nConclusions: Our findings of the presence of EBV in the CSF of MS patients and of reduced T-cell immunity against latent EBV antigens may shed light on the role of EBV infection in the pathogenesis of MS.\\nBecause studies in other autoimmune diseases have shown that sex-related factors appear to influence the risk associated with carriage of different HLA molecules, we set out to test a larger cohort of patients to determine if there are HLA associations with CIDP, and whether these differ depending on the gender of the patients.\\nWe have found that there are also increased levels of antibodies specific for PLP, particularly for the extracellular loop consisting of amino acids 180-230, in patients with MS compared to healthy controls and patients with other neurological diseases (OND).\\nAntibodies could have functional pathogenic effects in MS via a variety of mechanisms such as causing demyelination by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity or complementdependent lysis, or via opsonization of myelin resulting in phagocytosis.\\nIn vitro, exposure of primary rat astrocytes to antigenactivated myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cells resulted in the decrease of astrocytic glutamate uptake rates as far as v max was concerned.\\nIn conclusion, T cell-derived TNF-a impaires glutamate clearance capacity of astrocytes in vitro and probably also in vivo in autoimmune inflammatory disorders providing a pathogenic link to glutamate excitotoxicity that may be responsible for early axonal dysfunction remote from active inflammatory demyelination.\\nFurthermore, sorting of memory CD4+CD44hi according to the expression of either CD62L or CCR7 providing central (TCM) or effector (TEM) memory T cells demonstrated more severe EAE induced by TEM than TCM associated with increase proliferation and high production of IFNg in response to MOG peptide in vitro.\\nOur data suggest the presence of specific mechanisms of disease mediated by memory CD4+ cells and has relevance to the treatment of human autoimmune disease by costimulatory signal blocking agents.\\nA recent study from researchers at the University of California found that the anti-myelin antibody is found in virtually all patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (Brown, 2002) .\\nIn our study, we report on a 43-year-old patient with a diagnosis of progressive multiple sclerosis; the disease that has resulted in rapid regression over the past 5 years.\\nWe compared the effects of both anti-CTLA4 antibodies in murine relapsing remitting autoimmune disease experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a demyelinating disease mediated by PLP139-151 specific CD4+ T cells in SJL /J mice.\\nTo study the effect of this polymorphism on susceptibility to multiple sclerosis, we screened genomic DNA samples from 98 definite MS patients and 97 unaffected ethnically matched individuals as healthy controls, using sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP).\\nThe results indicated that the frequency of GG genotype (related to low production of TNF-a) was significantly increased in MS patients compared to controls while the frequency of GA and AA genotypes (related to high production of TNF-a) decreased (df = 2, P = 0.04).\\nOur objective was to study the peripheral role of CRH on T lymphocyte and antigen-presenting cell (APC) activation in an immune mediated disease model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).\\nThe antigen presentation function was examined by MOG-specific wild-type T cell proliferation in response to MOG-loaded crh -/or crh +/+ APCs. Anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulated InBa phosphorylation in crh -/splenocytes was tested by western blot analysis.\\nRecent work using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) indicates that patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) show altered brain activation on motor and cognitive tasks relative to controls.\\nConclusion: Human myelin specific T cell lines both CD4 + and CD8 + can be expanded in vitro from a relatively small blood sample facilitating immunological studies of such cells in multiple donors.\\nBackground: Peripheral T cell activation and their migration into the central nervous system(CNS) are involved in the pathogenesis of EAE.Targeting the IL-2 receptor, which shares the gand h portions with the IL-15R, suppresses immune responses.The IL-15Ra chain is specific for IL-15, and is expressed on CD8 + , natural killers, macrophages,endothelial cells and tissues such as brain, spleen and thymus.\\nOutcomes measured included clinical disease, cell proliferation measured by thymidine incorporation, cytokine profiles measured by ELISPOT assays, and immunohistological staining of the CNS at day 15, 30 and 40 post immunization.\\nResults: Early treatment with the combination fusion proteins decreased disease severity(MMG 0.6; pb0.0001) and incidence(P = 0.01)significantly compared to the control Ig group (MMG=2.4).\\nTreatment with any of the infusion proteins induced a high background proliferation of splenocytes; but MOG peptide-specific proliferation was suppressed in splenocytes from IL-15Fc(P = 0.002) as well as combination therapy (Pb0.0001) treated mice.\\nProtected mice showed an increase in MOG-specific IL-4 production when compared to the control group (Pb 0.03).\\nStaining for inflammatory cells in the CNS showed a decrease in CD4 + and macrophage infiltrates in the protected groups, particularly in those receiving combination therapy.\\nThese studies demonstrate that MLN DCs acquire fed antigens and induce the expansion of CD4+LAP+ T cells in situ which then may participate in specific tolerance to fed antigens and regulation of autoimmune processes associated with oral tolerance to autoantigens.\\nAlthough the aetiology of the progressive neurological loss has not yet been fully elucidated, it is believed that genetically determined susceptibility and environmental triggers are both implicated in the detrimental immune response against components of the myelin sheath, where myelinspecific T cells are thought to play a central role.\\nDue that dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells important for the activation of self-reactive T cells, we are interested in evaluating their therapeutic potential in the regulation of autoimmune responses.\\nIn addition, transforming growth factor (TGF-h) was shown to be involved in the recovery from EAE as the percentage of CD4+CD25+ cells expressing TGF-h latency associated peptide (LAP) on the cell surface increased significantly in blood and spleen of EAE-recovered mice as compared to the naRve mice (P b 0.001 and P b 0.01, respectively) and in vivo neutralization of TGF-h abolished recovery from disease.\\nOur results demonstrate that CD4+CD25+ regulatory cells mediate recovery from PLP139-151-induced EAE in SJL/J mice in which TGF-h plays an important role.\\nIn addition to influencing the presence or absence of disease, genetics may also play a significant role in individual variations in prognosis and differential response to therapy among patients.\\nThese loci were genotyped using DNA from a large MS patient registry which was established as a longitudinal study aimed at finding biomarkers of disease risk, prognosis and response to therapy.\\nTo address this question, we examined sex differences in antigen-induced cytokine-secreting cells between untreated relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients and controls.\\nThe hypothesis posits that acetylcholine receptor alpha subunit (AChRa)specific CD4+ T cells, which escape central deletion, migrate to the thymus where, during the course of a nonspecific inflammatory reaction, they are activated by intrathymically expressed autoantigen.\\nAs CD8+ T cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of MS, we established an experimental system to generate human, GA reactive CD8+ T-cell lines and clones, which demonstrated an antigen specific, dose dependent proliferation und IFN gamma production.\\nThe aim of our current study was to investigate the cytokine profile of GA-reactive CD8+ T cell lines derived from MS patients and controls.\\nConclusions: The data presented here demonstrate that the cytokine spectrum secreted by GA reactive CD8+ T cells differs in untreated MS patients and healthy controls and that this cytokine shift may be partly corrected by initiation of GA treatment in patients suffering from RRMS.\\nHowever, these data demonstrate that TLR2 and TLR4 expression on CD14+ cells may undergo large intraindividual fluctuation over time, a fact that needs to be taken into account in any future association of these molecules with human disease.\\nIn this study we examined immunological biomarkers by analyzing relevant molecules on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with MS, both ex vivo and after in vitro stimulation using flow cytometry-based assays.\\nWe measured a battery of cytokines, chemokines and their receptors, activation markers, and costimulatory molecules longitudinally in more than one hundred patients with MS enrolled in the Multiple Sclerosis Natural History Study at the Partners MS Center in Boston.\\nThe patients in different categories of disease and in different treatment subgroups were recruited and followed prospectively for up to three years with consecutive measurements of immunological markers, clinical assessment and MRI measures.\\nThis prospective multi-parameter analysis of immune markers with clinical responses and MRI support represents a systematic approach for the identification of surrogate markers of disease activity and treatment response in patients with MS.\\nIn EAE, increased CO has a variety of potentially beneficial effects including the protection from 1) nitric oxide synthase, 2) cellular infiltration, 3) macrophage activation, and 4) inflammatory processes including TNF-a production.\\nCONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a powerful COmediated amelioration of EAE and suggest that further study of halothanes would be warranted to define their potential benefits in the treatment of human autoimmune diseases such as MS.\\nFollowing induction of EAE, mice that lack IFNg or its receptor develop a very severe disease that progresses rapidly to paralysis and death, compared to a milder relapsing-remitting phenotype in wild-type littermates.\\nWe induced EAE in wild-type and IFNg-deficient mice by active immunization with PLP139-151 peptide in CFA, and investigated expression of these two cytokines by real-time PCR.\\nBackground: Myelin/oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a potent encephalitogenic antigen in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS); it is a known target for pathogenic demyelinating antibody responses in EAE.\\nDesign/Methods: Sera of 37 MS patients with different disease stages, and 13 healthy control subjects (HC), chosen according to their reactivity against recombinant extracellular human MOG (rhMOG 125 ) determined by solid-phase ELISA, were tested for the presence of anti-rhMOG 125 IgG by incubation with the biotinylated rhMOG 125 in solution.\\nThese data suggest that a local inflammatory response occurs within the muscle tissue of patients with IBM that may indicate the presence of a humoral antigen-specific response present in muscle.\\nIn the present report we show the application of a recently developed method for whole genome amplification (WGA), the multiple displacement amplification (MDA) (Dean, Gen Res 2001), to single cells FACS-sorted from human blood.\\nThe notion that the process of B cell affinity maturation with ensuing production of potentially pathogenic autoantibodies may occur inside the CNS of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is supported by the presence, within lesions, of oligoclonal B cells and cell surface markers capable of supporting such a local immune response.\\nThese data suggest that a local inflammatory response occurs within the CNS tissue of patients with MS which includes differentiation and affinity maturation.\\nFurthermore, depletion of CD25+ T cells with anti-CD25 antibody treatment prior to immunization with the encephalitogenic peptide resulted in induction of EAE in these otherwise resistant mice.\\nBackground: Following activation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs), co-stimulatory pathways including B7-1 and B7-2 recognizing CD28 and CTLA-4 play a key role in the activation of autorreactive lymphocytes, also CD40 ligand is expressed by activated T cells and is considered to be a critically T-cell marker, and their increased expression might further contribute to cognate T-B cell interactions and autoantibody production.\\nObjective: The aim of this study was to explode, which preferably co-stimulatory via in APCs interacting with CD4+ T cells, and which are the correlation with activity disease in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid Arthritis patients.\\nConclusion: Costimulatory molecules play an essential role in the activation and regulation of T cell immune responses in lupus and arthritis patients trough CD28, CD30, CD152, CD154, CD80 and CD86, they could be used to monitoring the activity disease and also could be a target for therapeutic manipulation of the costimulatory system in order to beneficial effects in clinical autoimmune disease Keywords: PBMCs, CD4+, CD28+, CD14+, CD19+, CD152, CD154, co-stimulatory molecules, CD80, CD86, disease activity, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Rheumatoid Arthritis.\\nThese results demonstrate that CR2 and CR1 are required for robust development of CIA, likely because of altered T cell activation and trafficking to the joint or because of defects within the anti-CII antibody repertoire.\\nWe and others have recently shown that leptin, similarly to other pro-inflammatory cytokines, can promote the differentiation of T helper (Th1) cells and can contribute to the onset and progression of organ-specific autoimmunity in several animal models of autoimmune disease.\\nTaken together, these studies point to an important role of leptin in the development and progression of lupus in BWF1 mice and raise the possibility to consider leptin antagonists as novel therapeutic tools for immune intervention in systemic autoimmunity.\\nThe results presented in this study suggest that hyperhomocysteinemia is not significantly increased in patients with Hughes syndrome.\\nIn addition in SLN patients, serum levels of Anti C1q and Anti Histone antibodies significantly correlated with Anti dsDNA levels and with increased activity index in renal tissue (P b 0.05).\\nGene expression studies have demonstrated increased interferon (IFN)-inducible gene (IFIG) expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of many patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).\\nThe objective of this study was to examine the hypothesis that increased disease severity and activity as well distinct autoantibody specificities characterize SLE patients with type I IFN pathway activation.\\nIn order to do that, freshly isolated PBMC from 77 SLE patients, 22 disease controls (DC), and 28 healthy donors (HD) were subjected to real-time PCR for 3 IFIG that are preferentially induced by IFNa, and the data were used to derive IFNa scores for all individuals.\\nSLE patients with high (H) and low (L) IFNa scores were compared for clinical manifestations of disease, disease severity, disease activity, serologic features and potential confounders by bivariate and multivariate analysis.\\nPatients with H scores showed increased disease activity, as measured by lower C3, hemoglobin, absolute lymphocyte count, and albumin, and higher anti-dsDNA titer, ESR, and SLEDAI-2K score.\\nLogistic regression analysis confirmed that renal disease, higher SLICC DI scores, low complement levels, and presence of anti-RNA binding protein (RBP) autoantibodies were independently associated with a H IFNa score, and suggested that the same might be true for the absence of treatment with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ).\\nOur earlier studies of Rituximab treated SLE patients have shown that shortly after treatment both proliferation and cytokine secretion decreased in in vitro cultures, and increased with the return of B cells in the circulation.\\nResults: Similar to our ex vivo patient data, both proliferation and cytokine secretion were reduced in B cell depleted PBMC cultures as compared to intact PBMC cultures.\\nDiscussion: Our in vitro experiments indicate that it is not the immunosuppressive treatment that accounts for the decreased immune response seen in Rituximab treated SLE patients, but a per se effect of the lacking B cells.\\nTo this end, we studied the frequency, cytokine profile and heterogeneity of NKT cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of 23 RA patients and 22 healthy controls, which included paired PBMC-synovial fluid (SF) samples of 7 and paired PBMC-synovial tissue (ST) samples of 4 RA patients, respectively.\\nUsing flow cytometry, a decreased NKT cell frequency was observed in blood of RA patients compared to healthy controls.\\nIntracellular FACS analysis of the cytokine profile of CD4+ and CD4-PBMC derived NKT cell lines of RA patients revealed that both produced significantly less IL-4 compared to those of healthy controls.\\nHere, we analyzed the effect of TNF and its neutralization on MHC class II expression and function of antigen presenting myeloid cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\\nMonocytes were isolated from the peripheral blood of RA patients before and after anti-TNF-mAb treatment and from controls by negative selection, differentiated in vitro into macrophages and analyzed by flowcytometry for HLA-DR expression.\\nHLA-DR expression was significantly reduced on myeloid cells from RA patients with active disease, but was increased to normal levels after TNF mAb treatment.\\nThus, anti-TNF treatment might lead to augmented T cell activation by myeloid cells, thereby promoting immune responses to (auto)antigens and the development of antinuclear antibodies that are frequently associated with anti-TNF therapy.\\nIn this study we investigate the presence of regulatory T cells in different compartments of patients with rheumatic joint disease.\\nAdditionally, 20 SpA patients were treated with etanercept for one year, providing a unique head-tohead comparison of autoantibody induction during TNFalpha blockade in a human disease model with low baseline autoimmunity.\\nConclusion: This study indicates that the prominent ANA and anti-dsDNA autoantibody response is not a pure class effect of TNFalpha blockers, is independent of the disease background and is not associated with clinically relevant lupus-symptoms.\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease and immune function in SLE is paradoxically characterized by active T cell help for autoantibody production, along with impaired T cell proliferative and cytokine responses in vitro.\\nThis study was designed to investigate the expression levels of various chemokines and their receptors in relation to the disease activity of juvenile SLE, and to compare the pattern of chemokine elevations with that in normal individuals.\\nSerum levels of chemokines including CCL-2, CCL-5, CXCL-8, -9 and-10 were analyzed by chemokine cytomeric beads arrays (CBA), whereas the expression of chemokine receptors such as CCR-2, -3, -4, and-5 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were assessed by real-time RT-PCR and/or Western blot.\\nSignificantly higher serum levels of CCL-2 (MCP-1), CXCL-8 (IL-8), -9 (MIG) and-10 (IP-10) were found in most SLE patients analyzed, while their chemokine receptors such as CCR-2, -3, -4, and-5 were expressed relatively low in patientsT PBMC.\\nTaken together, the data indicate that GpG-ODN treatment can modulate immune cell function and ameliorate disease in the NZB/W model of lupus nephritis.\\nThe protective mechanism of the GpG-ODN in murine SLE may involve general inhibitory effects on costimulatory molecule expression by antigen presenting cells, as well as alteration of T cell cytokine profiles.\\nClinical trials of the oral treatment of patients with autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis with type II collagen and myelin, respectively, showed disappointing results.\\nIn the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor rolipram, that was previously reported to produce suppressive cytokines including TGF-beta and IL-10, can facilitate the suppression of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA) in mice by oral administration of the inducing antigen.\\nWe report a case involving a 45 year old female patient with severe autoimmune disease and B cell immunodeficiency who was treated with rituximab.\\nConclusion: Our patient with a severe, refractory autoimmune disease and underlying B cell defect responded successfully to addition of rituximab, specifically targeting a B-cell mediated autoimmune process.\\nWe demonstrate that autoreactive B cell responses targeting deiminated epitopes and elevated serum concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFa, IL-1a, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-15) were present in a subset of early RA patients with features predictive for development of severe RA.\\nWhile citrullination of polypeptides under the influence of peptidyl arginine deiminase (PAD) has been shown to be unregulated in normal mice following the induction of inflamma-tion (Streptococcal cell wall (SCW) induced), these mice do not develop an immune response to citrulline or chronic arthritis.\\nThis was followed by a strong citrulline specific T-cell response only in the DR4 tg mice, presumably by the inflammatory induced expression of PAD and citrullinated fibrinogen.\\nThese observations are consistent with our previous studies indicating that the T-cell response to citrulline is restricted by MHC class II molecules expressing the shared epitope.\\nAlthough deficiencies in the components of the classical pathway of complement activation were among the first identified risk factors for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), only a few studies addressed their significance in patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE).\\nFli1 is expressed in the thymus and spleen and its overexpression in mice results in the development of immunological renal disease similar to that observed in systemic lupus erythematosus.\\nFurthermore, elevated levels of Fli1 in peripheral blood monocytes from lupus patients correlates with disease activity.\\nIn presence of patient non-T cells, maternal CD8+ cells showed an increase of HLA-DR expression (24% vs 8.4% when cultured alone) but neither proliferation nor IFN-gamma production, whereas CD4 cells remained quiescent.\\nIn contrast, both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells derived from the patient were activated in presence of maternal non-T cells, as shown by increased HLA-DR expression (41.6% vs 16.4% in absence of maternal non-T cells for CD4+ cells, and 32% vs 11% for CD8+ cells) and secretion of IFN-gamma.\\nThis observation suggests that chronic activation of T lymphocytes related to long term persistence of maternal cells and exposure to organic solvents might lead to a GVH-like disease reminiscent of SSc. SWR mice are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) despite carrying the arthritis susceptible haplotype H-2q and being able to produce of anti-collagen type II (CII) antibodies following CII-immunization.\\nGoal of these experiments is to identify the role of type I IFN inducible ADAR1 in editing of protein kinase A (PKA) and ADAR2 gene transcripts of normal and SLE patients.\\nInduction of nasal tolerance to H471 in NZB mice suppressed CD86 surface expression and led to downregulation of T cell proliferative response and cytokine production.\\nSimilar studies with other anti-CD8a mAb did not induce TNF production, suggesting that particular epitopes of CD8a activate Mo, and mAb specific for surface proteins of Mo do not indiscriminately enhance TNF production.\\nIt is possible that some effects attributed to CD8+ T cells, where T cells have been inadequately characterized, are due in part to CD8+ Mo. Introduction: Several studies have shown the diagnostic usefulness of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) and anti-Sa antibodies in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but up to now there is no study that has assessed both autoantibodies simultaneously in a cohort of patients.\\nConclusions: Modified proteins induce a tissue remodeling, promoting the recovery of cartilage proteoglycans, down-regulating the expression from some proinflammatory cytokines and promoting the chondroid cells proliferation.\\nNo significant differences were observed when we compared patients with and without anti-afodrin antibodies, neither in epidemiological data, in time of disease evolution, nor in clinical manifestations.\\nConclusions: In our environment, IgA anti-alpha-fodrin antibodies are not common in patients with SS (5.9% vs 90-60% of the literature), and are not associated with any specific clinical manifestation.\\nThe pathogenic role of TNF can be evidenced by: It has been observed that in plasma, synovial fluid and tissue of patients with RA high concentrations of TNF are found; transgenic mice that over-express the human TNF gene develop a polyarthritis similar to RA, while the administration of human TNF monoclonal antibodies from their birth, prevent the articular lesions and diminish the incidence of murine arthritis and, probably the most notable piece of evidence, comes from studies in which it has been demonstrated the clinical benefit of patients with RA treated with anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies or with soluble receptors of TNF.\\nOBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work is to study the historic evolution of RA, which it would be considered an increasing disease, relatively new, favored by a specific mutation at position-308 in the promoter region of the TNF gene.\\nIn studies of association of de SNP-308 and RA, the positive findings have been: in Caucasic population the allele TNF2 is 3 times higher in patients with RA, than in healthy controls; a relation between the SNP-308 and the presence of extra-articular manifestations with rheumatic nodules; in Swedish patients it has been demonstrated that individuals bearing the heterozygous form, develop a more severe disease and at an earlier age, and a significant association with bad prognosis was found in Turkish patients with RA.\\nY. Lee, 1 Circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from SLE patients express high levels of Type I interferon (IFN-I) inducible genes.\\nLongitudinal studies showed that in individual SLE patients IFN-I inducible gene expression can fluctuate as much as 100fold.\\nHealthy subjects exhibited a different pattern: IFN-I expression was generally much lower at baseline, increased dramatically within 1-2 days in response to viral upper respiratory infections, and returned to baseline within 10 days; interestingly, the numbers of circulating PDCs/MDCs did not decrease during viral infections.\\nStudies in a mouse model suggested that the low circulating PDC/MDC counts in lupus are due to enhanced dendritic cell maturation (increased CD86 expression) and migration from the circulating pool to sites of inflammation.\\nIncreased expression of IL-1alpha in endothelial cells of capillaries and IL-1beta in mononuclear inflammatory cells, is a consistent finding in muscle tissue from myositis patients.\\nIncreased T cell associated and soluble TRAIL (sTRAIL) levels in serum from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have been previously reported.\\nIn this study we set to characterize the upregulation of both T cell associated and sTRAIL in vivo and the modulation of TRAIL expression and soluble protein release following T cell activation and IFNa exposure in vitro.\\nUsing flow cytometry the ex vivo expression of membrane bound TRAIL was higher on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from ten lupus patients compared to ten healthy controls, particularly on activated CD69+CD8+ T cells.\\nIn vitro, both T cell associated and sTRAIL were maximally induced by T cell activation plus IFN a in patients and controls.\\nAlthough both Tcell associated and sTRAIL were functional in vitro in inducing apoptosis of TRAIL sensitive Jurkat cells as determined by Annexin V staining and 51Cr release assay, the apoptotic activity of membrane TRAIL was 2.5 fold higher compared to that of sTRAIL.\\nIn conclusion, increased T cell associated and sTRAIL is a feature of active disease in lupus patients and likely reflects the in vivo T cell activation and IFN a production.\\nWe report the first study on clinical characteristics and disease course of patients with juvenile DM who were diagnosed, treated and followed-up in Hungary.\\nTo gain new insight into potential mechanisms of autoimmunity in humans, we have studied a cytokine-like molecule, pre-B cell colony enhancing factor (PBEF), a protein produced by sponges in response to xenogeneic cells and with nicotinamide (Nam) phosphoribosyl transferase activity in both bacteria and mammals.\\nFinally, the expression of Stat1, an inducible protein involved in both type I and type II IFN signaling, was elevated in PBMCs derived from SLE patients as compared to normal controls.\\nBecause of these early reports, the thiazoledinediones (TZDs) and other synthetic PPARg agonists are being studied in both animal models and human patients for their effects on inflammatory diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and multiple sclerosis.\\nIt was established, that in patients with systemic sclerosis deficiency of Zn, Fe and Mn is observed, increased value of Cu, Co and Cr, indicates clear correlations between the desease duration, level of activity, character of clinical sympthomes and some immunological parameters.\\nWhether anti-neutrophil antibodies and/or death-inducing molecules like TRAIL are responsible for the pro-apoptotic effect of SLE serum on healthy neutrophils is currently under investigation.\\nMethods: Pediatric subjects were studied to avoid the potentially confounding factor of FMc. We used Real-Time Quantitative PCR specific for non-shared maternal HLA alleles to quantify maternal DNA in peripheral blood from 38 subjects: 14 with SLE and 24 age-matched, healthy controls.\\nThese preliminary results suggest the hypothesis that immunological tolerance to MMc is intrinsic to normal biology but may be lost in chronic inflammatory disease, leading to tissue-specific inflammation.\\nIn addition, DCs expressing differential levels of MCH class II and co-stimulator molecules have demonstrated to interfere with the induction of CIA by a deficient presentation of antigen to T cells.\\nAim: To assess the capacity of DCs pulsed with peptides derived from type II bovine collagen (CII) to modulate the antigen-specific immune response in mice with active arthritis.\\nThis suggests that while MHC is the major predisposing factor, cytokines produced in response to antigen presented by the MHC molecule may determine severity of disease.\\nSignificant increased mRNA expression of TGFb and Foxp3 was found in CD8+CD28+Ti stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 after pCONS treatment, suggesting a role of TGFb and Foxp3 in the suppressor function of these CD8+ T cells.\\nMaterials and Methods: Forty pediatric SLE patients with nephritis were screened for high titer anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) by immunofluorescence and Western blot using HEp-2, leukemia (acute lymphocytic and myelocytic leukemia), and normal cells.\\nScreening different tissue expression libraries with patient sera may further characterize SLE autoantibody antigen specificities, improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoantibody production and end-organ damage in SLE, and may lead to the development of novel therapeutic interventions.\\nResults: In vitro studies from human NA-PBL and monocytes stimulated with PHA show that the incubation of the cells with A/L extract reduced the production of IL-2 (30% for NA-PBL, 48% for monocytes at 48 hrs) and TNF-alpha (~15% for both NA-PBL and monocytes at 48 hours and 35% for NA-PBL and 20% for monocytes at 72 hours).\\nIdentification of the disease-regulating T cell determinants within an antigen targeted in an autoimmune disease would be of significance both in better understanding of the mechanism of natural remission/recovery from acute phase of the disease and in developing antigen-specific immunotherapeutic approaches for that disease.\\nUsing the Lewis rat adjuvant-induced arthritis (AA) model of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we have defined disease-regulating T cell epitopes within the AA-related antigen, mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 (Bhsp65), and in its self homolog, rat hsp65 (Rhsp65).\\nOur results support a model for immunoregulation of autoimmune arthritis in which arthritic Lewis rats having inflammatory acute AA upregulate the expression as well as presentation of endogenous self hsp65 leading to priming of ambient C-terminal epitope-reactive T cells.\\nOur study is the first to explore genetic influence in development of congenital heart block in animal models, and results show that genes found in the rat MHC region are of significant importance for the penetrance of congenital heart block, while non-MHC genes appear to have little or no influence on the disease.\\nHowever, the exact changes of the components of the immune system including impairments of different cytokines levels preceding the development of clinically overt type 1 diabetes mellitus remain not fully understood.\\nWe studied 10 patients with clinically overt type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 8-15 years old before initiating of insulin therapy and 10 aged-matched healthy control subjects.\\nWe found that serum levels of interleukins-16 were significantly decreased in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus compared to control subjects-94 F 9.99 pg/ml vs.\\nTherapeutic efficacy was associated with a peptideTs immunogenicity and ability to promote Th2 spreading late in the disease process, but not its affinity for I-Ag7 or its expression pattern (g-cell specific/nonspecific, or rare/abundant).\\nImmunological analysis revealed that draining lymph nodes of mice treated with the pro-apoptotic DNA vaccine contained higher numbers of Treg with enhanced immunosuppressive function compared to control animals.\\nOur results indicate that delivery of a DNA vaccine alone can reverse the symptoms of an autoimmune disease, and suggest a real clinical potential for pro-apoptotic DNA vaccines in the treatment of immune-mediated inflammatory disorders.\\nWe observed that B cell deficient NOD mice, which are normally resistant to diabetes, develop the disease following PDL1 blockade whereas CD4 deficient NOD mice were resistant to PDL1 blockade; thereby suggesting CD4+ T cells play an important role in anti-PDL1 mediated acceleration of diabetes.\\nWe have previously developed an experimental autoimmune diabetes (EAD) model with insulin peptide B:9-23 immunization and/or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (PolyI:C), as a viral RNA mimic Toll-like receptor (TLR) activator, in transgenic mice expressing the costimulatory molecule B7.1 in their islets (drivenly the Rat Insulin Promotor, RIP).\\nOur studies indicate that human A2 is permissive for the development of diabetes in EAD but does not accelerate disease in the model following either TLR3 activation or peptide B:9-23 immunization.\\nStudies are underway to define potential islet peptide A2 restricted antigen presentation using ELISPOT analysis in this model of immune mediated h-cells destruction.\\nIn conclusion, our cellular immunity studies provided no evidence supporting association of rotavirus infections with T1D or presence of T1D-related autoantibodies in young children.\\nIn order to evaluate the involvement of above mentioned processes in altered nociception at diabetes conditions the intensity of lipid peroxidation processes have investigated as well, as activity of enzymes of cell antiradical protection, superoxid glutathione reductase dismutase in diabetic patients erythrocyte membranes at the conditions of opioid receptors blockade and sensitization.\\nIn our hands, such cells can be induced via oral or intranasal administration of insulin, proinsulin peptides and DNA vaccines expressing islet antigens and efficacy is associated with IL-4 and IL-10 production.\\nMechanistically, we observed increased numbers of proinsulin specific antigen-induced Tregs producing IL-4 and IL-10 in mice that received combinatorial therapy compared to those receiving anti-CD3 alone.\\nThis raises the possibility that antigen-specific T R may be useful therapeutically in autoimmune diseases by localizing generalized suppressive activity to tissues expressing select target antigens.\\nSurprisingly, in a model of virally-induced autoimmune diabetes, local expression of TGF-h in h-cells under the control of a doxycycline-dependent promoter resulted in increased islet infiltration and disease incidence.\\nImmunomodulatory effects of NBI-6024 in recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients in a phase I clinical trial (NBI-6024-0003) were measured using the ELISPOT assay in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.\\nThis Phase I clinical study demonstrated that NBI-6024 treatment did not enhance, but rather suppressed, the pathogenic IFN-g response of recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients in a dose-dependent fashion.\\nThe purpose of the present study is to investigate the clinical usefulness of quantifying serum KL-6 levels for diagnosing and following up sarcoidosis in patients with uveitis.\\nThese results were compared to published studies of in vitro immunogenic responses to TYR and TRP-1-derived peptides by HLA-DRB1*0405restricted T cells from patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease.\\nMethods: Individuals diagnosed with birdshot chorioretinopathy (BCR) (n = 19) and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease (n = 25) were evaluated for both activating and inhibitory KIR genes as well as Class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) specificities using polymerase chain reaction protocols.\\nThe fact that a similar pattern was found in two different forms of uveitis with distinct clinical syndromes and known HLA associations implies that increased activating:inhibitory KIR genes may be a marker of risk for uveitis.\\nThus, the development of the infection process is characterized by aggravation of the insufficiency of the functional activity of the anti-HIV specific antibodies, confirmed by the marked reduction of their affinity.\\nAfter inoculation of promastigotes by sand fly, some individuals can develop type-1 immune response and control the infection, while others may be involved with acute form of the disease.\\nConclusion: According to our results higher levels of IL-10 at the time of diagnosis may act as an inhibitory factor for cellular immunity and have a role in the development of visceral leishmaniasis.\\nMethods: One hundred and twenty pediatric patients involved with kala-azar, 57 healthy individuals who were patientsT siblings and 102 healthy individual who lived in endemic area without any history of kala-azar or cutaneous leishmaniasis and with positive Leishmanin skin test were included in this study.\\nHere, we aimed to study the efficacy of these strains to induce apoptosis and modulate the expression of surface molecules and cytokine secretion in PMN of TB patients.\\nResults: A significant increase in Annexin V positive cells with corresponding decrease in CD16 and CD69 expression was observed with S7 and S10 strains when compared to uninfected control after 3hrs of infection.\\nAs compared to the uninfected controls, the MLN and the spleen showed significant proliferation of dual-Ab expressing B cells (Debc) on days 7 and 10 respectively, with the regional immune response proceeding ahead of the systemic response.\\nOur results thus indicate that the Debc were most likely expressing more than two isotypes on the surface during the peak days of the humoral immune response to the pathogen and such phenomenon occurred in both immunologic tissues.\\nTreatment of purified human T cells with these peptides down-regulated nuclear factor-nB activity and reduced the secretion of TNF-a and interferon-g.\\nCollections of peptides with properties of immunodominant epitopes that elicit the immune responses in patients, would be very beneficial for the research advancing into the immunology of the proteins and their relationships with the disease.\\nIn the ongoing experiments the peptides with best immunogenic and antigenic potentials are used in serological studies of patients and for their ability of inducing neutralization-effective responses in animal models.\\nThe present study investigated the role of both nicotine and Chlamydia heat shock protein 60 (cHsp-60) individually and in combination on viability, proliferation and apoptosis in human epithelial cell line (HEp-2).\\nThe results of these studies showed that treatment of HEp-2 cells with nicotine significantly increased cell count and viability compared to the untreated controls.\\nVy1 and Vy2 T cell clones transmigrate across endothelial monolayers in response to interferon-g inducing protein-10 (IP-10/CXCL10) and stromalderived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12) according to the expression of the specific receptors CXCR3 and CXCR4.\\nThis mechanism may contribute to the redistribution of the two gy T cells subset, the resident increasing in peripheral blood in early AIDS and removed from intestine in the advanced disease, supporting the importance of gy T cells in the first defence against HIV-1 infection.\\nCD4 + T-cell-lines specific for the entire set of adenovirus-derived proteins were generated after stimulation of PBMC from healthy adults with adenovirus-lysate 3 (Ad-Lys3) according to antigen-induced CD154 surface expression.\\nDirect qualitative cytokine profile of Ad-specific CD4 + T-cells was assessed after short-term stimulation of whole blood of healthy adults with Ad-hexon and coexpression analysis of CD154 with IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, TNFa and IFNg. Ad-Lys3-specific CD4 + T-cell-lines can easily be generated according to CD154-expression and showed high specificity for the adenovirus derived hexon capsid protein.\\nAntigenic peptides recognized by SARS virus specific CTLTs are useful tools for studying the CTL responses during infection enabling researchers to better monitor disease and develop T-cell mediated vaccines.\\nResults: The family study showed decreased perforin expression in CD 56+CD3-NK cells, CD8+CD3+ cytotoxic T cells in the father and Twin 1, and a normal expression in the mother and Twin 2 when we compared it with healthy controls of similar age.\\nAn evaluation for a possible defect in the innate and cell-mediated immune system revealed decreased natural killer cell lysis, an intracellular cytokine assay (ICC) for interferon-gamma production was negative for varicella, cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus, and influenza, a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin test was reactive to tetanus and mumps, and a lymphoproliferation assay (LPA) for mitogens and tetanus was normal.\\nHere we present data demonstrating that antibody can be internalised specifically through its binding to CD46 receptor, which suggests that CD46 may play an active role in mediating signalling events.\\nEither the access is restricted to activated cells that reacted with the expression and secretion of cytokines or could only be performed with a so far rare selection of specific peptide MHC-II multimers.\\nConclusions; Our present study provides a new model of severe liver injury, in which massive accumulation of innate immune cells such as DCs and macrophages in the liver by overexpressing GM-CSF enhances the susceptibility to LPS, leading to hemorrhagic liver injury with massive hepatocyte apoptosis after LPS injection.\\nwhipplei-specific reactivity occurs in healthy controls and that frequent exposure to the bacteria seems to activate immune reactions, whereas our results hint at a significantly reduced antigen-specific reaction of WD patients resulting in insufficient protection against the pathogen and onset of WD.\\nThe aim of this study was to determine the effect of psychological stress on the immune response to influenza vaccination in war related PTSD patients (n = 32).\\nPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and sera were obtained before and 14 days after vaccination (Agrippal, Chiron, Italy) from patients and control subjects during 2003/2004 winter season.\\nIn four of total ten HLA-A*0201+ patients 2-to 4-fold increase of frequency of recently activated influenza-specific T cells was observed after vaccination.\\nHowever, PTSP patients showed diminished frequencies of influenza-specific CD8+ T cells after vaccination compared to healthy controls.\\nT helper lymphocytes play a major role on infectious diseases and these cells can be driven into at least two different subpopulations according to their cytokine production pattern.\\nThe analysis of IgG isotypes response showed that both IgG1 and IgG3 were able to differentiate the group of patients presenting active lesions from the others (Kruskal Wallis; P = 0.0004 and P = 0.0004, respectively).\\nMoreover, the analysis of cytokine production revealed that IFN-g level was significantly higher on patients with active or cured leishmaniasis than on the asymptomatic group (Kruskal Wallis; pb0,0001).\\nbraziliensis antigens and the plasma levels of IgG1 and IgG3 antibody isotypes in patients presenting active lesions (Spearman Correlation; P = 0.0065 and P = 0,0107, respectively).\\nWhile, individuals with CC genotype can probably induce a Th1-type immune response more effectively and control the Brucella before developing the disease.\\nWe have recently shown that chronic chagasic patients with mild clinical disease have a significantly higher frequency of IFN-g producing T cells specific for a parasite lysate than do individuals with severe disease.\\nWe have identified a very specific set of class I MHC restricted peptides target of immune responses in patients capable of controlling T.\\nTo understand the origins of such responses and their potential role in disease we prospectively analysed the evolution of virus-specific CD8+ T cell responses, in five individuals, during and after acute infection.\\nThe results showed that the patients with low activity of CHE and decreased ALB were almost in low CD35 number groups, the levels of GLO, TBIL and GAM are increased accordingly.\\nThe detection of the Quantity of ECD35 maybe used as an important assay in liver functions Introduction: We have identified a group of patients with recurrent respiratory infections who have normal total immunoglobulins and normal response to protein antigens but who failed to develop IgG antibodies to the Pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7) serotypes.\\nMethods: This is a retrospective study of 60 patients referred to our clinic for evaluation of recurrent respiratory infections who received complete immunization with the PCV7 vaccine for age, according to ACIP guidelines.\\nChlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn) is an obligate intracellular bacterium known to cause acute upper respiratory tract infections, but recent studies show Cpn is also involved in a variety of chronic inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis and possibly autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis as well as arthritis and asthma.\\nIn fact, we have reported that this organism can be detected by PCR for Cpn specific 16s r RNA in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells associated with subclinical chronic bacterial infection.\\nEven though this organism grows preferentially in epithelium cells in the respiratory tract, in the present study we show that these bacteria can infect and replicate in the human monocytic cell line (THP-1) and the human T cell line (Molt-4) and also human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro as detected by FITC-conjugated anti-Chlamydia monoclonal antibody (specific to Chlamydia LPS) staining or PCR for Cpn 16s rRNA.\\nFurther studies are warranted to assess the role of Chlamydia on immune responsiveness, since Cpn are considered important in induction and progression of atherosclerosis, neurologic or autoimmune diseases.\\nWe have previously shown that in vivo cytolytic activity of CD8+ T cells specific for mycobacterial antigens could be detected in the spleen, pulmonary LN and lungs of infected mice.\\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between specific HLA phenotypes of patients and the predisposition to a chronic course of urogenital chlamydiosis in addition to in vitro production of IFN-g and interleukin (IL)-10 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).\\nConversely, significantly greater in vitro levels of IL-10 were observed in 83% of patients with the HLA risk-associated antigens for chronic urogenital chlamydiosis when compared to the study control subjects.\\nIn vitro production of IL-10 by PBMC from patients with chronic urogenital chlamydiosis and these HLA risk-associated antigens is significantly greater than in control subjects.\\nPost-trauma alterations in T-cell surface markers and functions are suggested to correlate with increased time to recovery and development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS).\\nSimilarly, stimulated intracellular cytokine (IL-2 and IFNg) levels were significantly reduced in T-cells from all trauma patients as compared to normal subjects.\\nOnly IFNg and CXCR3 (pb0.05 at 14 days post-injury) expression were significantly reduced in patients with a poor clinical course, when compared to the less severely injured subjects.\\nConclusively the functionally active FasL could be induced in the restricted cell types by HCMV infection and would be regulated with many cellular and viral factors in addition to the earlier reported HCMV IE2.\\nIn summary, these data indicate that therapeutic vaccination with IC41 can induce cellular immunity against HCV, and results from these studies provide first insights in the mode of action of IC41 on human T lymphocytes.\\nWe therefore incubated whole blood of vaccinated infants with BCG in the presence of neutralizing antibodies against these molecules, and showed a median 11% to 25% increase in soluble IFN-g production (ELISA), suggesting that these Treg effector molecules do indeed control conventional BCG-induced immunity.\\nTo determine whether IL-10-producing Tregs (Tr1 cells) were present, we measured BCG-induced CD4+ T cell-specific expression of this cytokine (flow cytometry).\\nResults: Mice infected with MHV-3 via trachea developed typical interstitial pneumonia with pathological characteristics of leukocyte infiltration, hyaline membranes formation, exudation of fibrin fluid within the lung, presence of vascular thrombosis in the pulmonary vessels and died within 5 days, while all mice in control group survived with no inflammation in lung.\\nIn addition to the physical damage of virus replication in lung and immune organs including spleen, liver, the up-regulation of novel gene mfgl2 in lung in association with fibrin deposition and microvascular thrombosis may play a vital role in the development of Recognition of microbial infection and initiation of host defense responses is controlled by multiple mechanisms.\\nNaive B cell activation via TlR9/RP105 pathway may play a beneficial role through profound their expansion and generation of antigen specific low affinity antibodies.\\nTaken together, this novel HLA screening procedure represents a versatile tool for supertype-binding analysis and will have profound use in the understanding of antigenic peptide selection, degeneration and discrimination during T-cell mediated immune responses.\\nThe majority of the studies done mainly in murines show the resulting alterations from Zinc deficients and the stimulus or the protection induced by the metal in some cell cultures, however, there are evidences that demonstrate that Zinc supplementation in vitro or in vivo can cause disturbs in the immune system.\\nAs a result IL-27-EBI3 KO mice showed a markedly attenuated proinflammatory cytokine response as indicated by decreased expression of IL-6 in both blood and peritoneal lavage, whereas bacterial concentrations in blood were similar to those in control mice.\\nThe efflux transporter Pglycoprotein (P-gp) is an important component of the BBB and an HIV-1 induced increase in P-glycoprotein expression could be one of the mechanisms for reduced intracellular accumulation and resistance to anti-retroviral agents resulting in the progression of HAD.\\nIn order to verify potentially autoimmune epitopes we analyzed 21 overlapping C-terminal peptides (20 mers each differing by only two amino acid residues) and 9 N-terminal peptides previously described as heart-tissue cross-reactive by proliferation and cytokines secretion assays using 09 heart-infiltrating T cell lines (HIL) obtained from rheumatic heart disease (RHD) patients.\\nResults showed an increased CD19+ lymphocytes (P b 0.05) without alteration in T lymphocytes Or CD4+/CD8+ ratio and number of CD3-/CD16+, CD56+ cells but decreased NK activity(P b0.05).\\nMethods: Tumor cells were isolated from the bone marrow or peripheral blood of 6 patients with AML (4 cases of primary AML and 2 cases of recurrent AML; 4 boys and 2 girls with ages ranging from 1 to 14 years).\\nThis study addresses the expression status of the signal transducing proteins and its role in the immune impairment in patients with cancers of the oral cavity.\\nCell proliferation assay clearly demonstrated defects in cell proliferation to T cell specific mitogen and majority of the oral cancer patients showed decreased response to PHA and anti-CD3.\\nDecreased CD4 + / CD8 + ratio with an increase in suppressor cells, reduced lymphocyte proliferation and production of IL-2 suggest a defective immune regulation in cancers of the oral cavity.\\nAnother possibility is treatment of malignant patients by anti-IL-10 antibodies with unpredictable consequences and complications in relation to autoimmunity and immune complexes disease.\\nTo be better estimated role of TNF on PC cell line, originally developed from patients with myelodisplastic syndrome at Institute of Oncology Sremska Kamenice, Novi Sad, we monitored the kinetics of changes after in vitro treatment with or without TNF-alpha in presence anti-CD45 and CD95 MoAb, IL-3, FLT3 and GM-CSF.\\nOur results showed that in comparison with untreated cells, TNF-alpha induced significantly increase in apoptosis and necrosis, in PC cells, which expressed high level of CD95 and TNF alpha receptors.\\nAt diagnosis, around one third of patients showed increased serum levels of sMICA that correlated with white blood cell count and that decreased upon therapy with imatinib mesylate (IM), a specific BCR/ABL inhibitor.\\nObjective: To study the effect of MTX-loaded process on innate immune adherence activity to tumor cells of adult and cord blood erythrocytes.\\nResults: We observed that the innate immune adherence activity of erythrocytes from adult and cord blood after hypotonic swelling treatment significantly increased as compared with other groups ( P b 0.05), which the rate of rosette formation was up to (61.45 F 8.51)%, (17.00 F 2.16)%, respectively.\\nConclusion: The results suggested that the red blood cells and complement plays a vital role in regulation (IL-8, IL-6) of hema immune reaction.\\nCD4+CD25+ T cells may play an important role in mediating immune tolerance by regulating T cells which cause autoimmune disease.\\nImmunophenotypic analysis indicates that patients with CML who relapsed after allogenic BMT have a higher proportion of CD4+CD25+ T cells compared to those who are disease free.\\nIn conclusion, these preliminary results are the first showing antigliadin IgA immunoreactivity in some patients with myeloma multiplex; they set up a question on the importance of gluten intolerance, (or of some parasitic/or bacterial infection which could induce anticalreticulin/antigliadin immunity ?) in the emergence and development of myeloma multiplex.\\nTherefore we decided to correlate the expression of long and short isoforms of these proteins in bone marrow, peripheral blood lymphocytes and lymph nodes of patients with different lymphoproliferative disorders.\\nThe heterogeneity of effector functions displayed by Rituximab and other anti-CD20 mAb which apparently recognize the same CD20-epitope suggests that additional mechanisms, probably related to mAb fine specificity, can be responsible for B cell depletion.\\nOur results indicate a unique fine specificity of Rituximab and suggest a possible mechanism to explain the recently reported ability of Rituximab to increase acid sphingomyelinase activity in raft microdomain.\\nThere was no significant difference in the ratio of Th1 cells compared to controls both in untreated and treated cancer-associated dermatomyositis patients (21.0% vs.\\nIncreased DCs expressed lower levels of I-A d than that of DCs from normal mice and had low allo T-cell stimulatory activity.\\nConclusion: We have identified circulating immature NK cells with immunosuppressive activities during the development of leukemia, which is important not only for understanding the development of the disease, but also for effective immunotherapy.\\nThus, we conclude that in vitro cell viablity may be useful as a prognostic marker and the study of this biological difference in acute leukemia patients may lead to a further understanding of the mechanisms that control cell survival and relapse.\\nBackground: Cervical carcinoma is a human papilloma virus (HPV)-related malignancy, in which escape of the tumor from the hostsT immune response is thought to play an important role in carcinogenesis and may involve alterations in the expression of immune-regulatory molecule genes.\\nThe purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the expression levels of CD28, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated-4 (CTLA4), inducible costimulator (ICOS), ICOSL, CD80 (B7-1), CD86 (B7-2) and Granzyme B (GrB) genes and response to treatment in cervical cancer.\\nConclusion: Besides prognostic potential concerning response to treatment, this finding also suggests association of more aggressive tumor process with a particular immune activation profile.\\nWhen in vitro cancer cell-killing study with macrophages activated by GcMAF was performed in the presence of serum or IgG fraction of GcMAF-treated prostate and breast cancer patients, greatly accelerated cell-killings (more than 80% of cells in 4 hrs) were observed.\\nThese results suggest that the macrophages activated with GcMAF kill cancerous cells via Fc-receptor mediation preferentially and that GcMAF-therapy develops IgG antibodies against the tumors.\\nThe presence of clonal B cells in the BM and blood of AL patients is relevant for understanding the pathobiology of disease and also has significant implications for therapy.\\nIn contrast, soluble CD28BP protein has the capacity to inhibit mixed lymphocyte reactions and antigen-specific T cell responses in vitro making it a suitable candidate for autoimmune therapeutic applications.\\nWe induced anti-Trp-2 180-188 /K b melanoma specific CD8+ T cell responses by DC vaccination and compared their efficacy to control either subcutaneous or pulmonary metastases of B16 melanoma in CD28-deficient and wildtype mice.\\nRationale: We hypothesized that the malignant B cell has significant autocrine function inducing its own replication and sought to establish its role in its own survival by evaluation of its cytokine profile compared with B cells from phenotypically normal (NL) peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow aspirates (BM).\\nMethods: Discarded BM or PB specimens from patients diagnosed morphologically and immunophenotypically as ALL (n = 16) or CLL (n = 18) were evaluated for induced expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), IL2 and IL4 and compared with NL BM or PB specimens (n = 13).\\nConclusion: Stimulated ALL and CLL B cells express TNF suggesting a possible role for this cytokine in the pathogenesis of these malignancies.\\nAccordingly, we found that in four antigen-positive cell lines of variable V599E B-raf mutational status (two heterozygous wildtype /mutant, one homozygous wild type, and one homozygous mutant), transient over-expression of mutant B-raf resulted in increased ERK activation and reduction of Melan-A/MART-1 and gp100 antigen levels.\\nTumor cells expressed moderate to high levels of both HLA class I and class II molecules, suggesting that tumor cells could directly interact with and influence TILs. In addition, a majority of the GBMs examined (n = 10) secreted high amounts of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10.\\nTumor cells expressed moderate to high levels of both HLA class I and class II molecules, suggesting that tumor cells could directly interact with and influence TILs. In addition, a majority of the GBMs examined (n = 10) secreted high amounts of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10.\\nPurpose: To analyze differences in response to treatment of ocular Adamantiades-BehcetTs disease (ABD) in the 1970Ts, 1980Ts and 1990Ts. Methods: Medical records of thirty six patients with uveitis due to Adamantiades-BehcetTs disease followed at the National Eye Institute (NEI) were reviewed.\\nAntigens introduced in the anterior chamber of the eye are processed and presented by resident antigen presenting cells (APCs) in a manner that results into antigen-specific peripheral tolerance that is characterized by suppression of Th1-mediated immune response such as delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH).\\nAntigen presenting cells treated with TGFh, were found to up-regulate their expression of InBa. In this series of experiments we have assessed contribution of InBa to tolerance promoting properties of APCs. Macrophage hybridoma stably expressing anti-InBa siRNA or ectopically overexpressing InBa were examined for their ability to express InBa protein (using western blot), suppress OVA-specific DTH and secrete IL-12 in culture supernatants.\\nAntigen presenting cells (APCs) in the anterior chamber of the eye are known to induce antigen-specific systemic tolerance in which Th1-mediated immune response such as delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) is suppressed.\\nProducts of these genes, via various pathways contribute to systemic tolerance induced by TGFhtreated APCs. More recently, we detected increased expression of extracelluar matrix protein, thrombospondin (TSP), in TGFhtreated APCs. In this report we have assessed molecular interactions of TSP that lead to tolerogenic phenotype of these APCs. Conventional APCs (either hybridoma cell line #59) or thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal exudates cells (PECs) can express TSP receptors such as CD47 as well as CD36.\\nMacrophage hybridoma #59 or peritoneal exudates cells collected from wild type(WT) or TSP-1 null or CD36 KO mice were used as APCs. These APCs, pulsed with ovalbumin (OVA) and treated with TGFh2 (5 ng/ml), were examined for their ability (1) to suppress OVA-specific DTH response, (2) to inhibit IL-12 secretion by ELISA and RT-PCR and (3) to enhance TSP or TNFa expression by RT-PCR.\\nThese results support the possibility that TSP expressed by TGFh-treated APCs contributes significantly to tolerance inducing property by facilitating inhibition of IL-12 secretion and expression of TNFa. Interaction of TSP with its receptor CD36 is essential for the tolerizing phenotype of TGFh-treated APCs. 1 7 IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, has been shown to exhibit stimulatory functions including CD14 upregulation on human monocytic cells.\\nOur flow cytometry results show that LPS-induced CD14 expression on monocytic cells may be mediated by endogenously produced IL-10.\\nTo understand the mechanism underlying the polarization tolerance in Ly-6A.2 over-expressing CD4+ T cells, we examined their cytokine profile in response to varied antigenic stimulation under primary culture conditions.\\nOur results suggest that Ly-6A.2 expression on CD4+ T cells diminishes their membrane proximal signaling in response to the antigen receptor and therefore might contribute to their altered cytokine profile.\\nThese results also suggest that CD4+ T cells capable of producing high levels of Th1 and Th2 signature cytokines in response to antigen stimulation are resistant to polarization to either Th1 or Th2 phenotype.\\nWe can conclude that elevated serum interleukin-6 levels could reflect an activation of generalized inflammation in patients with metabolic syndrome, which could contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis and high risk of cardiovascular disease in these patients.\\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of SOCS and their modulation in PMN and in the PLB-985 cell line following cytokine stimulation.\\nCIS and SOCS2 mRNA levels varied in cells following stimulation with the cytokines we used, but their protein expression remained stable suggesting the existence of another mechanism governing their expression.\\nThese cells express a known receptor for TWEAK, FGF-inducible molecule 14 (Fn14), which is restricted to epithelial and mesenchymal cell types, including synoviocytes and chondrocytes, and is highly upregulated in contexts of injury and inflammatory disease.\\nConclusion: The primary T-cell responses towards anti-TNFa treatment is affected by CD28 induced co-stimulation and TGF-h1.\\nPatients with SLE had increased histone acetylation at their TNF alpha locus in monocytes compared to controls suggesting that epigenetic changes may participate in disease perpetuation.\\nThe aims of this study were to investigate how nerve conduction velocity in the peripheral nervous system correlates with immunological and inflammatory markers and age-associated diseases.\\nELISA measured plasma concentrations of sIL-1h and sIL-6 as well as level of IL-2 and IL-4 spontaneous and after stimulation by LPS and PHA mitogens after 24h and 96h in peripheral blood mononuclear cell culture supernatants were determined in 40 Chernobyl clean-up workers 12-17 years after their work in Chernobyl and in 40 blood-donors without a history of occupational radiation exposure.\\nSpinal cord injury (SCI) consists of two phases, instantaneous cellular destruction and axonal damage caused by the initial mechanical trauma, followed by progressive injury termed bsecondary injury,Q resulting from exposure of surrounding tissue to excitatory amino acids, cytokines, and oxidative metabolites from cellular debris or invading immune cells.\\nTumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), a central pro-inflammatory cytokine known to be activated after SCI, is important in triggering cell death and is negatively regulated by cAMP elevation.\\nThis selective overexpression of EBI3 by transformed cells suggests that EBI3 may play a role, independently from its association to p28, to regulate anti-viral or antitumoral immune responses.\\nIn this study, we analyzed the role of Pin1 on cytokine expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).\\nThe serum levels of interleukins (IL) 1-beta, 6, 8, 10, IL-1receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), CD8, and CD4 lymphocytes were studied in 83 patients with acute pancreatitis.\\nTreatment of the stimulated DCs with EGCG, the primary polyphenol catechin in plant products, inhibited in a dose dependent manner production of IL-12 important for activating immune cells against intracellular bacteria like Legionella.\\nFurther studies are warranted to determine the mechanisms of the effects of this and other catechins on cytokine production by immune cells, such as DCs. TSG-6 protein, the secreted product of TNF-stimulated gene 6 (TSG-6), is an important endogenous mediator of inflammation and female fertility.\\nTo gain insights into the role of TSG-6 we investigated whether TSG-6 protein affects the expression of inducible cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), a key enzyme in inflammation and immune responses.\\nTSG-6 treatment of cells also resulted in a rapid increase in COX-2 mRNA levels, suggesting that TSG-6 up-regulates COX-2 gene expression.\\nThis work provides the first demonstration that TSG-6 can influence the expression of a gene regulating inflammation in a cell culture system, which may help to gain a better understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological functions of TSG-6.\\nResults: The levels of NO and TNF-a produced by the macrophages from the mice injected Colon26/IL-23 cells were higher than those from control mice at both time-points.\\nExpressions of mIL-23 in murine colon carcinoma cells can induce murine macrophages to secrete higher levels of NO and TNF-a and has anti-tumor effect.\\nResults: Some adenotonsillar naive phenotype CD4+ CD45RA+ and most memory phenotype CD4+ CD45R0+ T cells expressed high levels of activation antigens, such as CD69.\\nStrikingly, the PBMC performed frequently better under serum free conditions: increased numbers of cytokine producing cells were elicited by the recall antigens without an increase of activity in the medium control.\\nThe immune mechanisms that lead to chronic liver damage and cirrhosis in hepatitis C have not been elucidated but are increasingly being attributed to nonapoptotic, unscheduled cell death and release of a variety of DAMPs including uric acid, S100 proteins, heat shock proteins, and HMGB1, each acting in a cytokine like role with specialized immunoglobulin type receptors including RAGE and TLR2 and TLR4.\\nCONCLUSION: The mononuclear cells from AP patients express higher induced TNFa and IL-1h levels than healthy individuals in an ex vivo culture system.\\nThis conclusion is based on a systematic study at all possible levels of analysis: on receptor expression, signal transduction, effects in vitro, and effects in vivo.\\nIn skin from patients with psoriasis, high levels of IL-22 were highly significantly associated with strongly upregulated expression of b-defensin-2 and b-defensin-3 suggesting a protective effect of IL-22 in this disorder.\\nIn these patients IL-1 beta local application significantly increased functional activity of leukocytes isolated from the inflammatory sites tested in the assays of neutrophil migration to fMLP, superoxide production, adhesion and phagocytosis.\\nBackground: Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a complex lung syndrome of varying intensity and clinical presentation that result of an immunologically-induced inflammation in response to a large variety of inhaled antigens.\\nThus, subacute patients exhibited significantly higher numbers of T-cells expressing CXCR3 (40.6 F 10.7 % versus 25.6 F 7.3% in chronic cases).\\nSardar Sindhu, 1, 2, 3 Maude Loignon, 1 Evaluation of T H 1/T H 2 cytokine modulations is important to determine the immune competence and/or restoration in chronic HIV patients undergoing initial highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) intensification (GM-CSF, Hydroxyurea, and ddI), therapeutic vaccination (Remune TM ) and structured treatment interruption (STI).\\nWe evaluated serum levels of interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha, IL-15, IL-4, and IL-10 in 10 patients enrolled in the Canadian HIV Trials-140 pilot study.\\nTherefore, it was concluded that these immunomodulatory therapeutic interventions were able to induce/maintain a T H 1-dominant cytokine profile in these patients whereas suppressed IL-15 levels at 2 nd peak VL and thereafter might be due to a deregulated innate immune response.\\nCells activated with MLIF expressed an increased production of constitutive pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1h, IL-2 and IFN-g (262, 245, 46 pg/ml respectively) when compared with the production of constitutive basal RPMI cell controls (26, 18, 10 pg/ml respectively).\\nRationale: Since blockade of the IL-21 pathway with soluble IL-21RFc resulted in a reduction of clinical signs of arthritis in rodent models, we examined the effect of this pathway on rat and murine responses in vitro to understand the potential mechanisms of IL-21 regulation in arthritis.\\nIn the rat, Con A stimulated spleen cells or anti-CD3 activated splenic T cells were assayed for proliferation and cytokine secretion in response to IL-21 and IL-21RFc. Results: When compared with control animals, 3x weekly treatment with IL-21RFc resulted in less severe signs of disease in both rat and murine prophylactic and therapeutic models of CIA.\\nAddition of murine IL-21 to collagen restimulated LN cells resulted in a dose dependent inhibition of proliferation, and a decrease in IFN-gamma, GMCSF, and IL-6 and increase in IL-10 in the culture supernatant.\\nConversely, addition of IL-21RFc enhanced the collagen proliferation response and resulted in increased IFNgamma, GMCSF and IL-6 and decreased IL-10 production suggesting that IL-21RFc modulated endogenous IL-21, as well other antigen-induced cytokines.\\nConclusion: These results suggest that Interleukin 21 plays a role in modulation of antigen-specific T cell responses and this may contribute to the pathology of arthritis.\\nExperiments of differential gene expression and behavior in vivo of stat1-/-vs wildtype mice after IFN-g treatment are under way to further evaluate the importance of stat1 in NSCs. Conclusion: NSCs have a functional interferon genetic program.\\nThe utility of evaluating T cell functional assays is well recognized in the context of determining an efficacious vaccine strategy for infectious diseases/cancer, a tolerance profile in autoimmunity and transplantation, as well as for understanding the basic mechanisms of T cell immune responses in disease pathogenesis.\\nThe specific objectives of this study were to determine: 1) whether LThR signaling is crucial for HEV gene expression in adult wild type mice and 2) whether this is a direct effect on endothelial cells in induction of HEV gene expression.\\nBased on human cell culture assays and in vivo non-human primate studies, we have identified novel IMOs consisting of synthetic stimulatory motifs, which induce high levels of IFN-a.\\nThe aims of this study are to better understand the different functions of circulating OPG through an elucidation of the role of immune cells in its regulation and to explore new aspects of interactions between the immune and skeletal systems.\\nTo verify the pathophysiological importance of T cell-derived OPG, we chose to study circulating concentrations of OPG of patients infected with HIV-1 knowing that disease induced by HIV-1 is specifically associated with both compromised CD4+T cell number & function, and an increased incidence of osteoporosis.\\nOf the large number of cytokines released during the development of the immune response, T cell growth factors (TCGFs) such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-15 and IL-21 play major and distinct parts in T-cell activation.\\nMice that lack TNF receptor type 1 (TNFR1 KO) develop mild EAE but express high levels of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in the spinal cord.\\nThe present study examines the mechanism by which lack of TNFR1 results in increased IFN-gamma production using an in vitro coculture approach.\\nBoth WT and TNFR1 KO T cells produced significantly more IFNgamma when co-cultured with TNFR1 KO APCs compared with WT APCs. This observation was not altered by the addition of neutralizing anti-TNF antibody, demonstrating that the enhanced IFN-gamma secretion was not due to TNF actions through TNFR2.\\nPreliminary results show that mRNA expression of the p40 subunit of IL-12 was higher in co-cultures containing TNFR1 KO APCs compared to WT APCs. This suggests that the absence of TNFR1 on APCs leads to higher levels of IL-12, which results in higher IFN-gamma secretion by T cells.\\nIn conclusion, this study shows that lack of TNFR1 on APCs leads to greater IFN-gamma production by T cells, potentially due to a change in p40 expression.\\nIn experimental disease models HSP can be used as therapeutic agents to prevent or arrest inflammatory damage and first clinical trials using HSP peptides have shown a shift in pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles of peptide specific T cells to production of antiinflammatory cytokines.\\nIn order to analyze the mechanisms leading to HSP induced immune regulation we set out to test the possible protective effects of HSP70 in a novel mouse (BALB/c) arthritis model.\\nIn addition, joint sections of HSP70-pretreated mice showed less leukocyte infiltration, reactive synovial cell proliferation and cartilage destruction compared to the control group.\\nIn addition, we demonstrated that HSP70 preimmunization, indeed, activated T cells, altered the cytokine profile and modulated the immune regulatory response.\\nIn addition, using a newly prepared panel of mAbs to mouse and human CD200Fc, we compared the rank activities of antibodies for binding (FACS or ELISA) to CD200 with their abilities to augment immune reactivity in MLCs. Results: Peptides defining discrete regions in the N-terminal regions of CD200 and CD200R1 were functionally active in the different assays, including the assay which investigated blockade of CD200Fc-mediated suppression.\\nMoreover, infused in vivo, the same mouse-specific peptides suppressed protection from graft rejection afforded by injection of soluble immunosuppressive CD200Fc. Using the panel of mAbs, we observed again that only mAbs defining epitopes in the N-terminal domain could augment MLC reactivity (or block immunosuppression by soluble CD200Fc), while mAbs targeting C-domain epitopes, although reactive in ELISA or FACS (targeting cell surface CD200) were inactive in MLCs. In a final assay we compared by rank these different anti-CD200s for FACS staining of CD200 expressed on various cell types, including fresh dendritic cells and lymphoid tumor cells.\\nWe set out to study the potential involvement of human B cells and their cytokines in immune regulation and autoimmunity.\\nIn contrast, CD40 stimulation alone-a mimic of a B cell receiving bystander T cell help in the absence of specific antigen recognition-induces significantly less pro-inflammatory cytokines (n = 24; P b 0.0002) but significantly enhanced production of IL-10 (P b 0.004) that serves to suppress inappropriate immune responses.\\nWe further observed that this novel network of reciprocal regulation of B cell effector cytokines, is abnormal in a subgroup of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis where B cells maintain their capacity to proliferate and produce the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-a and LT (n = 18; P = 0.46 compared to normals), but have a significantly diminished capacity to produce IL-10 (n = 18; P b 0.02).\\nWe further observed that treatment was associated with a decrease in the proportion of circulating memory B cells, suggesting that the apparent reciprocal regulation of B cell cytokines mediated by mitoxantrone, related to differential effects on distinct B cell subsets.\\nSummary: We ascribe active roles for memory and naive human B cell subsets in appropriately promoting or suppressing local immune responses in the normal state through production of distinct effector cytokines.\\nWe further suggest that dysregulation of this B cell cytokine network occurs in some patients with the human autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis, and that this network represents a potential therapeutic target.\\nFurthermore, clinical studies carried out in patients with type 1 diabetes have clearly demonstrated that high levels of modified LDL-IC predict cardiovascular events.\\nFurthermore, we have shown that pharmacological inhibition of downstream targets of CD28 signaling such as PI3K and mTOR, as well as blocking IL-2 signaling using an antagonist antibody, all result in a significant increase in GRAIL expression, indicating that GRAIL is regulated by CD28.\\nTo determine whether these effects of CD72 on B cell tolerance have clinical relevance to the development of autoimmune disease, we induced EAE (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis) in both WT and CD72KO mice.\\nIn conclusion, based on these results we suggest that more than one amino acid regions in b-chains of DR and DQ molecules, predicted to be involved in processed antigen binding and helical regions, are important for disease predisposition and protection.\\nIn Vivo Blockade of Human IL-2 Receptor (IL-2R) Induces Expansion of CD56 bright Regulatory NK Cells in Patients with Active Uveitis.\\nIn this study, we report that administration of a humanized IL-2R blocking antibody induced a 4-to 20-fold expansion of CD56 bright regulatory NK cells in uveitis patients over time.\\nThe induced CD56 bright regulatory NK cells from the treated patients exhibited the same phenotype as those from normal donors except that they had a lower level expression of CD161.\\nIn addition, patients with active uveitis had a significantly lower level of CD56 bright regulatory NK cells in the periphery as compared to normal donors (P b 0.01).\\nCD4+CD28 null T cells have tissue damaging properties, are prematurely increased in both RA and MS patients and might therefore play an active role in the pathogenesis of these autoimmune diseases.\\nThe aim of the study is: to evaluate in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and/or cough: the presence of Helicobacter pylori antibodies and/or thyroid autoimmunity the histamine release and the prevalence of IgG autoantibodies against FceRIa and anti-IgE autoantibodies in patients positive for thyroid autoimmunity or Helicobacter pylori infection before and after levothyroxine sodium or HP eradication therapy Methods All patients had chronic urticaria and /or cough, for all of them the following investigations were performed: skin prick test for aeroallergens and food allergens, blood test for antithyroid antibodies (AAT, ATPO), FT3, FT4, TSH., Helicobacter pylori antibodies (IgG, IgA), total IgE, autologous serum skin test (ASPT) in patients with positive anthithyroid and HP antibodies, histamine-release activity, serum IgG anti-Fca RI e and anti-IgE in all patientsT sera Results Our preliminary data show: 100% of patients were with normal thyrotropin levels 100% of patients with thyroid autoimmunity had cough and 33% of them also had urticaria 100% of patients with HP positive had only urticaria and 41% of them also had cough 85% of the patients had ASPT and antibodies positive, 80% had ASPT and histamine release positive 70 to 100 % remission rate (either partial or complete) of urticaria and cough in patients treated with levothyroxine.\\n85% of the patients had ASPT and antibodies positive, 80% had ASPT and histamine release positive Conclusions These results suggest that histamine releasing autoantidodies are important in the pathogenesis of chronic urticaria and cough by stimulating or facilitating degranulation of basophils and coutaneous mast cells through cross-linking cell surface IgE receptors.\\nRESULTS An increase in the serum concentrations of both cytokines (gIFN, IL18) and growth factor TGFb 1 were noted in the studied group when compared to the control group.\\nObjective: The current study investigated the presence of autoimmune diseases (AID) among first degree relatives (FDR) of primary SjfgrenTs syndrome (pSS) and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) patients.\\nIn experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU), an animal model of autoimmune inflammatory eye disease, activated macrophages play a critical role in tissue destruction in the retina, since depletion of macrophages reduces retinal damage without concomitant reduction in numbers of other infiltrating cells.\\nPriming of T cells is only modestly impaired, but by the time the animals reach peak disease (day18-21), antigen specific proliferation in the spleen is significantly reduced in the TNFR1 -/mice.\\nTogether these results show that selected aspects of IFN-g mediated activation of macrophages are controlled by autocrine secretion of TNF-a, but that this control is bypassed in the presence of signals generated by pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognising receptors.\\nMoreover, IFN-gamma and IL-2 level was markedly increased in supernatant of Treg cells culture, protein levels of TGF-h, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12p40 and IL-13 were significantly reduced following h-tubulin immunization.\\nThe further study is required to elucidate the role of CD25 + CD4 + T cells in the pathogenesis of this disease, which would eventually result in better therapy.\\nThus, the innate immune stimulation that is needed to elicit EAU also activates regulatory T cells that help control the disease.\\nTo better understand where human autoantigen-reactive CD25 + Treg are selected and expanded we investigated if thymic CD25 + Treg from children and CD25 + Treg from cord blood are able to suppress proliferation and cytokine production induced by specific antigens.\\nObjective of the study: CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells (Treg) suppress T cell activation in vitro and regulate multiple immune reactions in vivo.\\nResults: We and others have previously shown, that in vitro blockade of the IL-2 receptor on Tregs during co-culture with responder T cells completely blocks their suppressive activity.\\nFurthermore, in vivo application of IL-2 by gene-gun immunization in normal mice selectively activates Treg and induces the complete suppression of proliferation of a transferred population of Ova-specific T cells in response to vaccination with ovalbumin.\\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by production of autoantibodies, in particular anti-nuclear antibodies, B cell hyperactivity and activation of self-reactive T cells.\\nPhenotypic analysis of T cells in 6-month old mice showed that levels of activation markers including CD62L, but also CD69 and CD25 were increased at least 2-fold on CD4 and CD8 T cells of CD48-/-mice compared to their WT counterparts.\\nA small population of CD4 + T cells present in both humans and mice has the ability to regulate immune responses.\\nThus IL-23 expression in dendritic cells (DC) may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human autoimmune diseases.\\nConclusions: We demonstrate that AS-oligos and siRNA can be used for immune modulation by targeting human dendritic cell (DC) gene expression.\\nUsing an experimental model of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) in C5aR-deficient mice, we show here that C5aR, although a nonphagocytic receptor, promotes cellular immune destruction in antibody-mediated autoimmune disease through a mechanism of bidirectional interaction between C5a and activating FcgR.\\nResults and Conclusions: In the present study, we identified C5a as a key mediator of AIHA and showed that mice lacking C5aR are resistant to this IgG autoantibody-induced disease model.\\nThus our data are consistent with a pathogenic mechanism of antibody-dependent hemolytic anemia in which IgG-opsonized erythrocytes trigger FcgR-mediated C5a release that in turn activates a positive cellular feedback signal uopn engagement of C5aR, which results in increased FcgRI and FcgRIII expression required for effective erythrophagocytosis.\\nAs similar results were obtained when testing Foxp3-negative suppressor cells, we conclude that IL-2 consumption by CD25-expressing T cells participates in a non-specific manner to the overall suppression of proliferation observed in these cultures.\\nAim of this study was therefore to identify regulatory memory cell subsets and to determine their markers and specific functions.\\nResults: In this study we show that the chemokine receptor CCR6 is expressed on a distinct subset of mouse Treg cells.\\nResults: Evidence of in vivo receptor editing in IgH56R bone marrow is revealed by comparing IgK gene expression in IgMa B cells (n = 143) to the IgMb control population (n = 184).\\nHowever, recently published data indicate that autoaggressive CD4 + T lymphocytes also express CD40, including T cells from mice with collagen induced arthritis (CIA).\\nThese findings are particularly exciting and suggest that T cell specific inhibition of CD40 signaling could be a means for blocking the autoimmune response without altering general immune function.\\nImportantly, a combination of A2-IgG and C2-IgG expressing B cells induced tolerance to the full length fVIII molecule, a result which supports the dominance of these domains in the immune response to fVIII.\\nViruses have been proposed as a triggering environmental event and some evidences have been reported, i.e. type I IFNs exist in the pancreata of diabetic patients and transgenic mice expressing these molecules in beta cells develop diabetes.\\nSince type I IFNs production takes place in cells infected mainly by viruses, our transgenic model could be an interesting tool for studying how the production of IFNbeta causes cellular stress, generates danger signals, inflammation and eventually NK cellmediated autoimmunity.\\nParenteral administration of anti-CD3 is efficacious in animal models of autoimmunity and in humans anti-CD3 is an approved therapy for transplant rejection and positive results have been reported in patients with new onset type 1 diabetes treated with parenteral anti-CD3.\\nThese results identify a novel and physiologic mechanism to induce regulatory T cells that is clinically applicable to a variety of immune mediated disorders.\\nWe are currently testing the hypothesis that the patients with high steady-state level of surface PF4 based on genotype and acquired through platelet activation are those most likely to generate autoAb, form ULC and develop HIT.\\nBackground: To detect the effects of potentially immunomodulatory drugs on autoreactive T cells, clinical trials performed by the Immune Tolerance Network employ assays that quantify T cell responses to autoantigens.\\nTo assess the influence of T cell proliferation on TREC levels, we measured telomere length in B-and Tlymphocytes in groups of 10 patients with AITDs (ITL and PBMC) and controls (PBMC).\\nResults: Transcriptional analysis in human PBMC revealed that calcitriol is a strong inducer of the VDRresponsive gene CYP24 which indicates these cells are responsive to VDR-mediated gene transcription.\\nWe found that hCDR1 treatment of BALB/c mice resulted in a marked elevation of expression of TGFh in vivo, and in TGFhinduced suppression of 16/6Id-stimulated T-cell proliferation exvivo.\\nIn addition, we provide evidence that one possible mechanism underlying the hCDR1 and TGFh-induced inhibition of T-cell proliferation is by down-regulating the expression, and therefore, the functions, of a pair of key cell adhesion receptors, LFA-1 (aLh2) and CD44, which operate as accessory molecules in mediating antigen presenting cell (APC)-T-cell interactions.\\nIn addition, Melan-A specific CD8+ T cells were efficiently eliminated by Melan-A peptide-loaded DC-FasL, supporting the concept to apply FasL-expressing bKiller-DCQ as a novel strategy for the treatment of T cell dependent autoimmune disease.\\nCONCLUSION: Treatment with bifidobacterium has beneficial effect on murine experimental colitis, the mechanism may be involved in such respect: Bifidobacterium inhibits proinflammatory cytokine secretion and NF-nB activation in inflammatory cells, limits colonic inflammation, downregulates Fas expression in colonic epithelia of murine inflamed colon, alleviates inflammatory damage of colonic epithelia and protects the integrity of intestinal mucosal barrier.\\nThe data suggest a different involvement of TNF expressing cells in the pathogenesis of both disease models.\\nObjective: This study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 5 as compared to 10 GCAP treatments in patients with moderate active steroid dependent UC.\\nResults: Compared to normal ileal mucosa from controls, biopsies from non-inflamed mucosa from IAP (UC and FAP) patients expressed elevated transcript levels for MRP-14, IL-8, IL-1h, IFN-g and MIP-2a.\\nInterleukin 21 (IL-21), a member of the common gamma-chain family of cytokines, is secreted by activated T cells and can have a diverse range of immunomodulatory effects dependent upon the particular context of the immune response.\\nRationale: In situ hybridization studies have shown that IL-21R is highly expressed in the lymphoid compartment in the gut, and the human IL-21R gene has been mapped to chromosome 16 within the CrohnTs Disease susceptibility region, suggesting that the IL-21 pathway may be involved in regulation of gut homeostasis.\\nResults: In culture, anti-CD3 stimulated CD45RB hi (naive) but not CD45RB lo (memory) CD4 + T cells proliferated in response to IL-21 and secreted increased levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, IL-18, IFN-g and TNF-a.\\nIn mice that developed skin inflammation, treatment with thrice-weekly IL-21RFc seven weeks after CD45RB hi cell transfer, resulted in reduced erythema, scaling and hair loss when compared to IgG2a-treated controls.\\nTreatment of CD45RB hi recipient mice with 200 ug IL-21RFc, 3 times per week at the time of cell transfer, resulted in a significant reduction of clinical signs of colitis as measured by body weight loss and stool score when compared with control -treated mice.\\nConclusions: Taken together these results suggest that IL-21 is a potent potential player in the inflammatory responses in this model and blockade of this pathway may be of therapeutic benefit in Th1 mediated diseases such as CrohnTs and psoriasis.\\nIn this colitis model, the transfer of CD4 + CD25-CD45RBhigh T cells (Teff) from normal mice to C.B-17 SCID recipients leads to the development of a Th1-mediated inflammatory bowel disease similar to IBD in humans.\\nIn this study, we investigated the role of c-Maf, a transcription factor known to induce IL-4 production, in inflammatory bowel diseases.\\nAlthough CrohnTs disease (CD) is associated with low IL-4 production by T-bet-expressing Th1 cells in the lamina propria, surprisingly a higher expression of c-Maf in these cells was found as compared with control patients.\\nIntroduction: Elevated production of TNF-alpha and activated T cells play a central role in the pathogenesis of CrohnTs disease (CD).\\nExperimental and clinical studies have indicated that cytokines play an essential role as mediators of inflammatory process associated with pancreatitis.\\nIn previous studies, the presence of IL-6 in human pancreatic cells had only been shown on biopsy material from diabetic patients or normal gland.\\nIn conclusion, the results presented herein clearly demonstrated a moderate and strong expression of IL-6 in exocrine and endocrine cells of patients with CP and CEP.\\nIn order to functionally analyze whether tumor derived TGF-beta may play a role in the induction of FoxP3+ regulatory T cells in vivo we induced colon tumors in mice overexpressing a dominant negative TGF-beta receptor specifically in T cells.\\nBy using a modified Serological Analysis of Recombinant cDNA Expression Libraries (SEREX) which is an antigen-screening approach utilizing humoral and cellular immune responses, we herein identify an epithelial cell-derived endogenous lectin, galectin-4 (G4), as a pathogenic mediator to exacerbate intestinal inflammation.\\nFunctionally, administration of anti-G4 mAb not only led to the attenuation of chronic colitis in B cell-deficient TCRa double knockout mice but also effectively enhanced the recovery from 3.5% DSS-induced acute colitis.\\nThese studies not only indicate the presence of an immunogenic epithelial lectin that contributes to the exacerbation of intestinal inflammations but also provide a novel insight into the biological role of lectin/CD4 + T cell interactions under inflammatory conditions.\\nIn conclusion, these studies clearly demonstrate a moderate and strong expression of Cu/Zn SOD in acinar, islets and duct cells of patients with CP and CEP.\\nThe aim of this study was to examine whether: (i) peripheral blood monocytes (PBMoC) respond to peptic digest of gliadin by IL-8 and or TNF-a production, (ii) this activity depends on the presence of IFN-g, (iii) there exist a difference in response of PBMoC isolated from blood donors, active and treated (GFD) coeliac patients (including analysis of the causal factors) (iiii) the signalling pathway is mediated via NF-nB molecule activation.\\nInterestingly, prestimulation of cells with IFN-g for 24 hours increased gliadin-induced TNF-a production in the group of healthy donors and patients on a GFD, and slightly in the group of active CoD patients.\\nThe impact of HLA-DQ2/DR3 antigen expression in healthy donors and the keeping of GFD in treated patients on cell response were evaluated.\\nConclusions: IL-8 and TNF-a produced by the cells of innate immunity could enhance the effect of gliadin specific lymphocytes and participate in the cascade leading to the damage of intestinal mucosa in celiac patients.\\nThe aim of this study was to investigate vitamin A levels in CVID patients and the effects of Vit A deficiency on cytokine production.\\nAs a result, our study shows that CVID patients have low serum Vit A levels and this finding correlates with their chronic inflammatory condition and supplementation with Vit A may have role in downregulation of inflammatory responses.\\nReduced percentage of IFN-gamma, IL-2, and TNF-alpha producing T cells after PMA stimulation in patients with hyper-IgE syndrome was found implying an impaired inflammatory T cell response.\\nIn conclusion, a dysbalance in T cell responses of patients with hyper-IgE syndrome was detected as described before, but no indication for an underlying defect in Toll-like receptor pathways was observed.\\nSince DC play a central role in T-cell activation, and in immunoglobulin synthesis, a failure of DC to mature into fully stimulatory cells and to present antigens may provide a more general explanation for the various symptoms of CVID patients.\\nUsing synthetic peptides containing the ELDKWA sequence from the gp41 membrane-proximal region recognized by the mAb 2F5 and mAb 2F5 as a positive control, we assayed in ELISA the reactivity with ELDKWA of IgG purified from sera of 30 Mexican patients with disease progression prepared prior to and after the initiation of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART).\\nThe detection of 2F5-like antibody in all 30 patients, not reported for other countries, may either be explained by differences in the infection phases investigated or assigned to the local genetic variations of HIV-1 found in recent epidemiological survey.\\nIn order to establish the role of plasma IL-7 levels before HAART as prognostic marker of CD4+ T-cells recovery in HIV-infected children, a retrospective longitudinal study was performed in HIV-children on first-line of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).\\nPatients and methods: The inclusion criteria were: a) to begin HAART with protease inhibitor; b) CD4+ T-cells V20% at entry to the study; c) at least 6 months on follow-up; d) more than one year of age.\\nMathematical modeling the transmission and dynamics of HIV infection can lead to a deeper understanding of the disparate experimental data and identify therapies most likely to be effective in controlling the disease.\\nPhenotypic features of the patients (presence of ATM protein, ATM kinase activity, CSA, serum AFP level, serum Ig levels, antibody production against pneumococcal polysaccharides, frequency of sinopulmonary infections, rate of progression of ataxia and outcome) were compared to genotypes.\\nThe purpose of our study was to examine the effect of new cytogenes-synthetic short peptides on the base of naturally originated brain and bone marrow immunoregulatory peptides, designed in our laboratory on blood count and the development of infections in patients with acquired neutropenia of different genesis.\\nThe results of the presented study indicate that cytogenes may to restore differential blood count, avert the development of infections and to put in complete recovery in patients with acquired neutropenia of different genesis.\\nAll of this patients were treated following complex immunotherapy in different combination: 1) local and systemic IFN therapy (recombinant IFNa-viferon-1, -2, -3, -4, viferon oil), using high-, middle-and low-dose therapy during 2,5-3,5 month-base therapy; 2) specific and non specific passive intravenous immunoglobulins (cytotect, pentaglobin, intraglobin, octagam) only if it was necessary; 3) immunomodulation therapy thymusTs factors (tactivin, tymogen, imunofan) was directed to restoration of T-cellTs immunity; 4) synthetic preparation with polyvalent effects as polyoxidonium and licopidum (reconstruction of NK and neutrophylic leucocyts).\\nThose effects had shown decreasing frequency of acute episodes of recurrent viral infections from 4-24 till 1-2 per year, elimination of viral pathogens (81,5% patients), reconstruction of destroy different immune mechanisms (88,8%).\\nEfficacy of GcMAF for several HIV-infected/AIDS patients was assessed by HIV-specific serum Nagalase activity because the serum Nagalase level is proportional to the amount of HIV-infected cells (or virus load).\\nFor immune monitoring studies during HIV vaccine clinical trials, whole blood specimens from HIV seropositive patients may be collected at multiple sites and sent to a central location for PBMC isolation, cryopreservation and evaluation.\\nThe performance of samples collected by these two methods was compared by assessment of antigen-specific CD8+ and CD8-T cell immune responses (using cytokine flow cytometry), and cellular viability and recovery (using a hemacytometer and Trypan Blue exclusion).\\nThere were no significant differences in the post-freezing IFNg response, viability, or recovery between PBMC derived by Ficoll-Hypaque and by CPT, suggesting that either collection method would result in comparable yields of the viable cells needed to perform equivalently in functional studies.\\nEGCG inhibits HIV-1 replication in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro by inhibiting the biochemical activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase resulting in a subsequent decrease in HIV p24 antigen concentration.\\nB cells subsets, stimulated in vitro immunoglobulin production (sIVIP) and specific antibody response to tetanus toxoid, HiB and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines have been evaluated in 15 patients (mean age 12-36 mo) with a) IgG values b2DS below the mean for age associated to low values of IgA and/or IgM; b) intact cellular immunity; c) absence of clinical and immunological signs of other immunodeficiencies.\\nGiven the increased incidence of eczema and autoimmune disease in WAS patients, we asked whether WASp might also be involved in T helper cell differentiation and function.\\nTogether, these findings suggest that WASp-deficiency has complex effects on T helper cell effector function, which may provide insight into the development of autoimmunity in patients with Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Two major clinical trials have demonstrated that weekly self-administration of SCIG with a 16% IgG preparation is safe and effective in patients with PID, resulting in normalized stable S-IgG levels and providing satisfactory protection against severe bacterial infections.\\nMost cases are described in patients with cell-mediated immunodeficiencies, and immunomodulatory treatment is often focused on enhancing lymphocyte function.\\nBased on the International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) and published articles, 99 patients with PID (22 females and 77 males) were identified: 59 (60%) with antibody production deficiencies, 15 (15%) with defective phagocyte function, 8 (8%) with combined B and T cell immunodeficiencies, 16 (16%) with T cell deficiencies, and one (1%) with primary complement deficiencies.\\nThe results show that (1) Leishmania enhances HIV-1 replication in both primary human macrophages and in human lymphoid tissues, (2) the Leishmania-directed increase in HIV-1 production is associated with a complex network of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a, IL-1a, and IL-6, (3) Leishmania also modulates the process of HIV-1 transmission through competition binding to DC-SIGN in dendritic cells, and (4) HIV-1, on the other hand, is also able to promote the intracellular growth of Leishmania in human primary macrophages through an enhanced uptake of the parasite.\\nThese findings help to unravel the molecular cellular mechanisms through which the two microorganisms interact, provide novel insight into the complex relationships between both human pathogens, and, most importantly, offer information that may be useful for the design of effective therapeutic strategies to control disease progression in persons dually infected with HIV-1 and Leishmania.\\nAIMS: Our objectives are to study the place of a new intronic mutation (640 GN A) as a molecular basis of HEA typeI, and to investigate the effect of sequence variation within the coding region of C1 inhibitor gene (polymorphism 566 T N G) on disease expression as it has been reported recently (S-A Cumming al, J Med Genet 2003, 40: e114) .\\nFonctionnel tests have shown no difference in C1 inhibitor synthesis dependig of the presence or no of 566 T N G mutation, and the severe clinical expression of the disease was observed in one patient without that mutation.\\nMethods: Tuberculin skin testing an evidence of tuberculous infection had been in practice since years as diagnostic tool for epidemiological study of the whole/random population, to judge the degree of control of tuberculosis & exclude/include indications for BCG vaccination.\\nConclusions: It is concluded that topical applications of honey on 3 degree burns, didnTt have significant effect on the number of mast cells in comparison with control and routine treatment groups.\\nThe present study investigates the quantitative and qualitative aspects of immune cells in the oral mucosa with correlation to disease progression.\\nIn this study, we were able to demonstrate that DC are the major epidermal cell population expressing the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 in situ, with AD patients showing the greatest expression.\\nCostimulatory molecules are an essential factor in the generation of an effective immune response, as failure to deliver costimulatory signals during antigen presentation leads to The standard procedure for diagnosing allergic contact dermatitis is to perform a patch test.\\nIn this study, we use the high-density microarray technology in the identification of differentially expressed genes in allergenstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from chromium-allergic patients versus healthy controls.\\nTo qualify for the gene expression study, chromium-allergic patients should show a positive patch test to both CrCl 3 and K 2 Cr 2 O 7 and mononuclear cell cultures established from the patients should have a strong in vitro proliferative response to CrCl 3 assessed with the 3 H-thymidine assay.\\nA total of 26 genes were differentially expressed by more than 2 fold (P b 0.01) in allergen-activated PBMC from patients compared to controls.\\nThis in vitro study identifies a peptide in the integrin a6 molecule to which Abs in the sera of OP patients bind, and which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of OP.\\nBackground: With the development of biological drugs it is important to perform immunological studies on patient samples, both to monitor the treatment, but also to increase our understanding of the mechanism of the drug.\\nAnd defining this function in inflammation; that is, understanding molecular pathways controlling NO production in macrophages, is an important step towards developing improved therapies for inflammatory diseases and primary immunodeficiencies.\\nThe present study was carried out to compare scatter profiles, surface antigen expression, and recoveries of rare and non-rare events in unwashed, centrifuge-washed, and CellPrep-washed cell samples.\\nPhosphorodiamidate Morpholino Oligomers (PMOs) are effective antisense agents for inhibiting gene expression; however limited uptake into populations of immune cells without the use of mechanical and chemical procedures often detrimental to cellular functions, restricts their usefulness.\\nIn the current study, the authors have attempted such an evaluation by integrating well-known techniques of flow cytometry-based phenotypic analysis and cell sorting with protein fractionation and analysis to better understand the complex nature of an immune response.\\nOur results therefore bolster the argument for K+ channel blockade as an immunotherapeutic strategy targeting mature antigen presenting cells, which has implications for the treatment of a wide range of immune-mediated diseases.\\nBy examining both global and antigen-specific cell mediated immunity, the Cylex platform is useful for monitoring the immune status of patients receiving immune modifying therapies.\\nMethods: Peripheral blood CD8+ lymphocytes from DF-Tol, chronic rejection (CR), healthy controls (HC), and patients with stable kidney function under immunosuppression (StA) were analysed by flow cytometry for phenotypic and cytotoxic markers.\\nConclusion: A strong cytotoxic CD8+ CD28-signature differentiates CR from DF-Tol and HC, suggesting a suppression of pathological cytotoxicity in DF-Tol. Further investigation of the targets of these cytotoxic cells and evaluation of these profiles to identify patients at risk for CR are warranted.\\nTo assess wether this state of tolerance is specific to their graft and not the result of a state of immunodeficiency, we studied the immune response of these patients following influenza vaccination.\\nSurface Enhanced Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectroscopy analysis was used here to profile sera from drug-free tolerant kidney recipients (n = 7) compared to recipients undergoing chronic rejection (n = 8) and control nongrafted patients with renal failure related to bnon-immunologicQ kidney diseases (uropathy, diabetis, n = 8) and whose renal function match that of recipients with chronic rejection Sera were fractionated into 6 fractions and each fraction was loaded on 2 different chromatographic surfaces (metal affinity IMAC30-Cu 2+ and cation exchange CM10).\\nIn this study we analyzed the comparative ability of EBV-peptide pulsed Type-1 polarized DCs (i.e. DC1) generated from IS SOTx patients and healthy donors to boost Type-1 (IFN-g) EBV-specific CD8+ T cells ex vivo.\\nMethods: EBV+/HLA-A02+ IS SOTx patients receiving chronic 2 drugs maintenance therapy (n = 9) or healthy controls (n = 10) were recruited for this study.\\nAfter 10 days of ex vivo stimulation with EBV peptide-pulsed DC1, the patientsT cocultures contained lower numbers of CTLs, as compared to healthy controls, suggesting a defect in patientsT T cell proliferative potential.\\nConclusion: Our results show that IS stable SOTx patients display Type-1 immune (IFN-g) responses against EBV Ags in their peripheral blood, to a degree comparable to that observed in normal controls.\\nAcute toxicity studies of choline oxidase protein in mice model showed no significant difference (p90.05) with control in growth, body weight, food consumption and blood biochemical indices.\\nWith this respect, the aim of our study was to compare the capacity of different proinflammatory cytokines to stimulate the gene expression, production and release of multiple CC and CXC chemokines by respiratory epithelial cell line.\\nA total of 96 chemokines and chemokine receptor genes has been studied using an oligoarray system (Superarray Inc.) in cultured human alveolar type-II like cells A549 stimulated by multiple concentrations of TNF alpha, IFN gamma, IL-1 beta, IL-18, and IL-33.\\nThe induction of epithelial cells by IL-1 related cytokines, IL-33 and IL-18, resulted only in a moderate upregulation of few CC or CXC chemokines compared to a potent effect of IL-1 beta stimulation.\\nAlthough the inhibition of cyclo-oxigenase (COX) pathway seems to play a central role in NSAIDintolerance, a very high prevalence of skin reactivity to autologous serum (AS) has also been reported in NSAID-induced UA, pointing to a possible involvement of the immune system in the pathogenesis of these forms.\\nOnly 4 patients with CU showed a positive cutaneous response to AS, whilst in the other subjects skin tests with both basal serum and samples collected during challenge-induced UA always elicited negative results.\\nBackground: Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the gene encoding plant homeodomain finger protein (PHF11) were shown by positional cloning to be associated with severe asthma and elevated circulating total IgE level in Caucasians.\\nVarious studies examined the association between -1903 G/A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the mast cell chymase gene (CMA1) and allergic phenotypes with inconsistent results.\\nNo significant difference between MFNS and placebo was revealed (SMD 1.02; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.25; P = 0.86; heterogeneity I2 = 1.0%) Conclusions: First among nasal CSs, MFNS efficacy achieved Evidence Ia in the treatment of allergic rhinitis.The frequency of adverse events is similar in both groups, when it was compared with placebo.\\nAt present only few systematic reviews of high methodological quality are available or in progress: evidence Ia of efficacy for antihistaminic treatment is provided by desloratadine which on 3108 patients showed a significant reductions in total symptoms scores, total nasal symptoms score and nasal blockage relief when compared with placebo; a meta-analysis confirms that also ebastine induces a greater decrease from baseline in mean rhinitis symptom scores than placebo (749 patients).\\nMometasone furoate is at present the only one nasal steroid which may benefit an evidence of effect Ia by means of an in-progress meta-analysis, whose preliminary results show in 2163 patients a significant reduction in total symptoms scores.\\nWe aimed to evaluate the effect of a naturally occurring grass pollen season and the anti-rhinitis treatment on the expression of cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLT(1)R) in the nasal mucosa of allergic rhinitis patients.\\nMethods: In a double-blind randomised study, 59 patients with allergic rhinitis received treatment with either nasal steroid (fluticasone propionate; FP, 200 microg/day), oral antileukotriene montelukast (ML, 10 mg/day) alone or in combination with antihistamine loratadine (LT, 10 mg/day), or placebo over the grass pollen season.\\nResults: The grass pollen season induced a significant increase in the CysLT(1)R expression in placebo (from 0.097 T 0.005 to 0.178 T 0.012 cells/ field), ML (from 0.113 T 0.011 to 0.148 T 0.009), and ML + LT (from 0.122 T 0.008 to 0.154 T 0.016), but not in FP (from 0.123 T 0.013 to 0.128 T 0.016) treated patients.\\nFP treated patients had significantly lower pollen-season induced change in the CysLT(1)R expression compared to other groups.\\nSubjects and Methods: The case control study was performed in three groups of patients, 106 AIA, 115 aspirin tolerant asthma (ATA) and 133 normal controls (NC).\\nAmong two SNPs, the polymorphism of CRTH2 at positions of -466T9C showed a significant difference in genotype frequency between AIA and ATA; AIA patients showed significantly higher frequency of homozygous TT genotype than combined homozygous CC and heterozygous CT genotype of CRTH2 -466T9C (p = 0.037, multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for age and sex, recessive model).\\nConclusion: These results suggest that GATA-3 may be directly or indirectly associated with CRTH2 -466C allele by stimulating mast cell activation with the release of Th2 cytokines and other proinflammatory mediators contributing the increased susceptibility of AIA in CRTH2 -466T9C promoter polymorphism.\\nClinical studies of RSV-infected patients indicated increased levels of Th2 cytokines and IgE, suggesting that an allergy-like condition developed during infection and skew the Th1/Th2 balance toward Th2 9 Th1.\\nComparative retrospective analysis of 76 children, who been admitted between winter seasons 2001 and 2005 for a first attack of brochiolitis before the age of 12 months, was performed in order to elaborate and correlate possible specificity of asthma in term of pathogenesis (A, NAA), immune response and compliance to treatment.\\nThese results indicate that immunological background via CD8+T cells may play an important role in the regulation of the differentiation and activation of the Th2CD4+Tcells during RSV infection.\\nConclusion: Results obtained from this study suggest the clinical importance of Blomia tropicalis as major source of allergens causing allergic sensitizations in tropical regions.\\nMethods: In vitro based tissue culture, quantitative RT-PCR, flow cytometry and antibody capture assays (ELISA, cytometric bead array) were used to study human CD4+ T cell phenotype and function following polyclonal activation (anti CD3, in the presence or absence of dexamethasone and/or 1?25VitD3.\\nCytokine levels in lymph node cell supernatants showed significantly increased levels of TGF-$ and significantly decreased IL-5, IL-10 and IFN-, in all treatment groups.\\nAnalysis of epitope-specific immune responses induced by vaccination with structurally folded and unfolded recombinant Bet v 1 allergen derivatives in man Background: Previously we have constructed recombinant derivatives of the major birch pollen allergen, Bet v 1, with a more than hundredfold reduced ability to induce IgE-mediated allergic reactions.\\nMaterials: Group of 34 subjects included: 19 individuals with allergy to grass pollen confirmed by medical history, positive skin prick tests (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE) min.\\nA; ii) Evaluation with questionnaires of clinical rhinoconjunctivitis symptom score during 2006 and 2007 pollen season (the endpoint) in groups A and B; iii) The flow cytometry analysis of blood samples was performed at the beginning of SIT treatment, after reaching a maintenance dose and at the end-point in gr.\\nConclusion: Lower count of CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T cells in both groups of allergic patients suggests a dysfunction within this population might contributes to the pathology of allergy.\\nResults: Significant increase of the HR2 mRNA level as well as the HR2/HR1 ratio was observed in PBMC of patients from the 3rd day of SIT.\\nThe up-regulation of HR2 expression on basophils in response to repetitive IgE-receptor cross linking as well as allergen challenge during the built-up phase of SIT might represent a key mechanism and early desensitization effect of SIT on the level of effector cells.\\nPreliminary works aiming at analyzing how bacteria interfere with Fc&RI signaling indicated that: 1) several intracellular signaling molecules had a reduced expression, 2) both early and late Fc&RI-dependent phosphorylation events were decreased, 3) I.B degradation was prevented, thus interfering with the nuclear translocation of NF-.B, 4) the IgE-induced increase of the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ was profoundly inhibited.\\nBackground: It is known that allergic inflammatory diseases such as asthma are Th2 cells-mediated, however, the pivotal roles of allergen-specific Th2 cells in the induction of allergic lung inflammation have not been fully elucidated.\\nConclusion: Blo t 5-specific Th2 cells played a central pathological role in mediating allergic airway inflammatory responses resembling those seen in humans.\\nThen in order to evaluate its diagnostic potential, we examined intracellular Foxp3 protein expression in circulating peripheral blood CD4 + T cells from allergic patients and healthy controls at the single-cell level.\\nBy performing a case-control study by matchedpair analysis to eliminate the influence of the Foxp3 + CD4 + level correlations with the total IgE level and eosinophil ratios, Foxp3 + CD4 + ratio was significantly lower in active atopic patients compared to asymptomatic donors having similar levels of IgE, eosinophils and IFN-,.\\nObjective: The aim of the study was to determine the additional therapeutic benefit of inhaled heparin in the treatment of hospitalized patients for acute asthmatic exacerbation and treated with inhaled bronchodilators and glucocorticoid therapy.\\nMethods: Thirty patients (20 male, 10 female), mean age( 31 +/j 10 years), admitted for acute exacerbation of asthma, participated in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.\\nOral sulforaphane safely and effectively induces antioxidant phase II enzymes in the human airway Substantial evidence implicates particulate air pollution exposure as an important factor for asthma exacerbations and the increasing prevalence of allergic respiratory disease.\\nWe conducted a placebo-controlled dose escalation trial to investigate the in vivo effects of sulforaphane, a naturally occuring potent inducer of Phase II enzymes, on the expression of GSTM1, GSTP1, NQO1, and HO-1 in the upper airway of human subjects.\\nRNA expression for selected Phase II enzymes was measured in nasal lavage cells by RT-PCR ( † Wilcoxon) Nebulized single dose formoterol powder (24 mcg) is as effective as three doses of albuterol and at one fifth the cost in children\\'s acute asthma; is well tolerated and patients of all ages can benefit.\\nMethods: Total and specific serum IgE to olive pollen was tested and evaluated in 400 allergic patients before, during and after the peak pollen season using immunoblot Allergy Screen-Respiratory pannel.\\nIt is worth to mention the importance of the total and specific IgE testing for olive pollen allergy detection and cross-reaction with other pollens and fruits Suggesting the presence of Ole e 10-like proteins in many sources which may be related to the development and exacerbation of allergic and asthmatic process, but these results could be interpreted with caution regarding clinical symptoms, signs, and skin prick testing.\\nBackground: Previous investigations established dose-response curves between the severity of clinical symptoms and specific IgE antibody levels to both indoor and food allergens in allergic individuals.\\nTo investigate the correlation between IgE antibody levels and threshold in vivo reactivity we determined specific serum IgE antibodies to timothy grass pollen (ImmunoCAPi, Phadia AB, Uppsala) at three time points during one year (June/July; October; December) and performed conjunctival and nasal provocation tests with grass pollen extracts at different concentrations (Phleum pratense, HAL Allergy, Duesseldorf, Germany).\\nConclusion: Measurement of specific serum IgE levels seems to accurately predict the in vivo reactivity with regard to skin prick test in patients with ARC to grass pollen allergen.\\nThe preliminary results indicate a good correlation between indicators of sensitization, but not between serum IgE levels and threshold allergen concentrations that induce symptoms Further data analysis concerning conjunctival and nasal provocation tests and symptom scores in a greater number of patients is in progress.\\nObjective and Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 22 patients with atopic dermatitis allergic to hen-egg ranging from 1 to 13 years in age, as well as from 9 healthy individuals who had no allergic symptoms.\\nResults and Discussion: IL-31 was preferentially expressed in CLA (skinhorming cutaneous lymphocyte antigen) as well as CD45RO-positive cells in atopic children complaining of skin lesions and pruritis compared to normal subjects.\\nObjective and Methods: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of TLR-2 agonists (LTA, PGN and Pam3Cys) on cytokine production and cell surface marker expression in human monocytes from AD patients with the TLR-2 R753Q polymorphism compared to AD patients with Bwild typeT LR-2 and control individuals to elucidate the functional role of the TLR-2 R753Q polymorphism.\\nThe study also aimed to analyze correlations between the level of examined proteins and such parameters as: skin prick tests (SPT) results, serum concentration of total IgE and coexistance of symptoms of other atopic diseases.\\nAD children with positive SPT results and detectable serum specific IgE presented with higher mean level of serum and urine eosinophil proteins than in compared groups of patients with negative SPT results and undetectable serum specific IgE, although with no statistically significant difference.\\nThe expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) is known to increase in the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and to be related to disease aggravation.\\nIn the present study, we measured skin NGF levels in AD patients and assessed the possibility of a relationship to AD severity, as well as effects of treatments.\\nThe presence of homozygosis for the delta32 (d32) polymorphism of CCR5 produces the absence of this receptor from the cell surface and heterozygosis promotes a very low expression of this receptor, hence reducing the availability of receptors capable of interacting with chemokines to induce the inflammatory response.\\nAlthough the cases may represent a more severe disease end spectrum, there are only few systematic publications on AD features in adulthood and our study provides valuable data on the performance of the diagnostic criteria and relevance of the individual clinical signs in this age group.\\nBackground: There is little data on the correlation between atopic dermatitis and other atopic diseases (asthma, rhinitis) and atopy markers (positive skin prick test and specific IgE to Dermatophagoides pteronissinus /Dpt./).\\nFarinae, D.Pter., House dust, Hay dust, Parthenium & Paltophorm among airborne allergens, while reactions were observed significantly positive to certain food allergens also ( Milk, Almond, Yeast, Hazel nut ) .Since there patients showed strong reactivity to certain allergens (IgE mediated hypersensitivity), an attempt was made to administer allergen immunotherapy course.\\nThese results further supports the concept that the combination of prohapten modified organotypic CYP cocktails with a dendritic cell-based in vitro model of contact allergens may streamline and increase the predictive efficiency of current safety test methods in allergic contact dermatitis.\\nOur current results indicate that DDR1 expression by eosinophils in the local inflammatory sites is specific for CSS and could be the disease marker in allergic skin diseases with eosinophil infiltration.Mechanisms of eosinophil survival and activation might be different between CSS and allergic skin disease such as atopic dermatitis.\\nConcentrations of serum total IgE, eosinophil count and plasma AD-associated chemokines (cutaneous T cell attracting cytokine, CTACK; thymus and activation regulated chemokine, TARC) were measured.\\nIn a subgroup of patients who had never had allergic rhinitis, asthma or urticaria (n = 26), log-transformed % correlated well with the objective SCORAD (Spearman\\'s rho = 0.554, p = 0.003).Levels of IgE, CTACK, and TARC and eosinophil count differed significantly among patients with mild, moderate and severe disease.\\nThe role of contact sensitization in contact dermatitis patients among the seaweed farmers in Bantaeng, South Sulawesi, Indonesia Atopic dermatitis remains one of the serious problems of pediatrics as prevalence of disease among children is quite high (10Y20 % according data of different countries) and have increasing tendency.\\nBackground: Epinastine belongs to the second generation of antihistamines and also possesses anti-inflammatory or anti-allergic properties in cutaneous as well as systemic allergy, including mast cell stabilization, suppression of costimulatory molecule expression, inhibition of eosinophils chemotaxis and granulocytes accumulation, and suppression of cytokine and chemokine production.\\nThe primarily therapeutic mode of action of FEX is generally believed to be owing to its suppressive effect on effector cell activation, which responsible for the development of allergic inflammation.\\nWe report a patient with typical features of HIES and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, in whom anti-IgE monoclonal therapy for allergic manifestations could be an effective therapeutic alternative.\\nResults: The patient improved her current symptoms of asthma since the first dose of Omalizumab and two months after the eczema severity decreased to a mild form.\\nHence, this newly developed combined method of treating atopic dermatitis has been proven to have a desensitizing and anti-allergic effect, which is indicated by the recovery of the functional activity of neutrophiles.\\nAim: To study NGF serum levels in top athletes, a population sample in which allergic diseases and neuroimmune disorders Y such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)Yare reported with a significant increased prevalence.\\nMethods: 103 male soccer players (mean age 26.1) from five first division teams were studied for allergic diseases trough an original specific questionnaire (AQUAc2007), history, physical examination, skin prick tests and/or Phadiatop.\\nThe skin prick-tests with different groups of allergens, the estimation of total IgE end IgA, IgM, IgG in blood serum, the challenge bronchial tests with physical exercise are used in modern clinical, laboratory and allergic research methods including gathering allergic, the pharmacological and food anamnesis.\\nConclusion: From this in vitro study we can conclude that beclomethasone dipropionate, when combined with salbutamol or formoterol, exhibits enhanced anti remodelling activity in bronchial fibroblasts, providing new insights on the additive effects of inhaled corticosteroids and $2-agonists for asthma therapy.\\nMethods: We have investigated suppressive effects of the fraction on an ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma in BALB/c mice and studied the cellular and molecular mechanisms of its anti-allergic activity.\\nConclusion: Considering that the pulmonary dendritic cells are crucial in the differentiation of Th2 cells and the production of IL4 and IL5 in lung tissues and that the cytokines are important in the IgE antibody production and eosinophil infiltration, the fraction appears to include an anti-allergic principle modulating the Th2 differentiation and the resulting allergic asthma development.\\nPatients\\' demographic, disease severity, pulmonary function test results and medication used were collected.\\nConclusion: Presence of Glu27 allele in Thai asthmatic patients is associated with better parameters of asthma severity, including higher percentage of predicted FEV1, less hospitalization and emergency department visit during the past year and significant lower amount of ICS/LABA usage.\\nProportion of eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic inflammation phenotypes in patients with mild to severe bronchial asthma, its influence on main clinical and functional outcomes and efficacy of inhaled steroid treatment Maris Bukovskis 1 , Normunds Jurka 2 , and Immanuels Taivans Background: Bronchial asthma is probably not a single disease, but a complex of separate syndromes.\\nObjective of our study was to determine the percentage of patients with eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic asthma phenotype, sputum inflammatory cell spectrum in each patient group, its influence on main asthma control parameters and ICS treatment efficacy.\\nMethods: Lung function, PD20 of Mch, induced sputum cell count, asthma symptom score and $2-agonist use was investigated in non-smoking, steroid naive and ICS treated patients with mild to severe persistent bronchial asthma.\\nConclusion: Non-eosinophilic asthma phenotype is associated with increased sputum neutrophilia, more severe symptoms, higher rescue medication use and less effect of ICS treatment on lung function.\\nMethods: High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and pulmonary function test were done as soon as possible after admission in patients with exacerbation of asthma and follow up studies were done after improvement of symptoms and discharge.\\nThe present study investigated the effect of soluble TNF-\" receptor on the airway inflammation in mice model of bronchial asthma.\\nConclusion: These results suggest that significant epistatic effect of fourlocus genetic interaction may exist in the susceptibility for AIA in asthmatic patients which may be a useful in vitro method to diagnose the AIA with acceptable sensitivity.\\nIL-5 production in response to Candida Albicans secretory aspartic protease 2 is the marker of isolated late-phase bronchial responses upon inhalation challenge for nonatopic asthma To delineate the mechanisms of nonatopic asthma, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from atopic asthmatics, nonatopic asthmatics, and healthy controls were incubated with various allergen molecules.\\nIL-6 research at BA patients in combination with AD revealed authentic (8G0,05) increase of serum level of present cytokine (3,31T0,22 pg/ ml) and decrease local one (0,97 T 0,06 pg/ml).\\nIn this report, we demonstrated that water soluble chitosan had specific immunomodulatory effects on dust mite allergen Dermatophagoides farinae (Der f)-stimulated, monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) in the shifting of Th2 cytokine polarization, decreasing inflammatory cytokine production of IL-6 and TNF-\", down-regulation of CD44, CD14, TLR14, and PAR2 receptor expressions, and inhibiting T-cell proliferation in the presence of allergen-stimulated MDM.\\nThe recent study using lung specific VEGF over-expressing transgenic mice showed that VEGF induced TH2 lung inflammation.\\nResults: On day 4, the number of total cells, macrophage, lymphocytes and neutrophils increased in BAL fluid from the mice sensitized with OVA in the presence of LPS compared to only OVA treated mice.\\nConclusion: VEGF induced during allergic sensitization and its signaling pathway play a key role in allergen specific T cell priming.\\nRecent studies show that interleukin-10 (IL-10) have an important role in the regulation of Th2 and allergic responses and decreased in asthmatic patients.\\nAim: The goal of our study was to investigate differences in expression of CysLTR 1 alternative transcripts I and II in patient with bronchial asthma and healthy control group.\\nThe results showed that antigen recall responses of lung culture from mucosal treated mice demonstrated an antigen-specific enhanced release of IL-10, but the concentration of this regulatory cytokine had no significant changes in splenocyte culture medium.\\nThese results suggest that mucosal immunotherapy with CpG DNA may induce local production of cytokines without systemic effects on Th responses.\\nMethods: Pulmonary function test, methacholine bronchial provocation testing, asthma symptom and medication scores were evaluated at regular interval in 35 patients with OA confirmed by specific challenge tests.\\nDiscussion: On the basis of our research, it is possible to identify some unexplored areas in HRQoL of patients affected by allergic rhinitis: the new ARIA classification (intermittent and persistent rhinitis) should be carried out for all the treatments in order to fully appreciate the effect of drugs used in AR on aldult and children patients_ HRQoL; the effect of comorbidity on HRQoL should be extensively investigated; HRQoL study should include some other aspects of patient_s perspective life (i.e. satisfaction, adherence).\\nThe positive effect on quality of life measures mainly in sleep, daily life activities and performance were increased, but combination therapy revealed significantly better results at the end of 21 days.\\nMethods: In a prospective case control study, 40 patients with suppurative chronic otitis media who were candidates for surgery and 38 healthy, sex and age-matched persons were evaluated for allergy using the standard questionnaire, prick test and serum IgE.\\nMethods: Three hundred and two children with symptoms of chronic rhinitis presented to a Pediatric Allergy Clinic between January to December 2006 were categorized into 2 groups, i.e, allergic rhinitis (AR) and nonallergic rhinitis (NAR) according to their skin prick test results.\\nMethods: A nationwide survey was organized in 2005 in Hungary with using the same questionnaire, filled two times ( at the start and at he end of treatment period) in.The patients participated in survey had allergic disease and was treated by levocetirizine during 6 months.Data of 17800 questionnaires were analysed.\\nObjectives: The aim of the study was to assess the effect of allergic rhinitis on quality of life in patient with atopic asthma.\\nResults were analyzed with SPSS 11.5 and prevalence of allergens was calculated in different groups of patients in regard to age, sex and type of allergic rhinitis (perennial or seasonal).\\nMethods: A total of 354 subjects, 10Y50 years of age, who in a screening questionnaire had reported a history of airway symptoms suggestive of asthma and/or allergy, or who were taking any medication for these conditions were clinically examined.\\nRelationship between histamine H1 receptor occupancy (RO) and reduction of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) by levocetirizine (L) in subjects exposed to pollen in an environmental exposure unit (EEU) Background: the estimation of in vivo RO, which takes into account the affinity of an H1 antihistamine for the histamine H1 receptor and its free plasma concentration, is a far better predictor of human pharmacodynamics evaluated by the inhibition of histamine or allergen-induced wheal & flare than considering in vitro affinity and plasmatic half-life only (Gillard et al.\\nConclusion: These results suggest that MMP-2 and 13 may play an important role in the pathomechanisms of allergic rhinitis and that this differential expression of MMP may contribute at least in part contribute to the differences between AR and asthma.\\nResults: Repeated intranasal sensitization with Cry j 1, the major allergen of Cryptomeria japonica pollen, in the absence of adjuvants significantly exacerbated nasal symptoms, Cry j 1-specific IgE and IgG1 production, nasal eosinophilia, and Cry j 1-induced in vitro production of IL-4 and -5 by submandibular lymph node cells.\\nMethods: At the start of the study, we looked at patients who reported increased allergic symptoms and in whom we had previously performed SPT.\\nTo further confirm this, in the present study we examined the levels of RANTES, eotaxin and SCF in the epithelium and lamina propria of patients with AR and the kinetics of RANTES+, tryptase+, and CCR3+ cells in the epithelium and lamina propria after nasal allergen challenge.\\nIn AR patients, we performed nasal allergen challenge with house dust mite, took biopsies at 30 min, 6 hrs, and 12 hrs and by immunohistochemistry, we examined the number of Tryptase+ RANTES+, eotaxin+ and CCR3+ cells as compared to control.\\nWe have tested this hypothesis by investigating correlation between the expression of GR-\", GR-$, and NF-0B proteins in patients with allergic rhinitis and the responsiveness to GC treatment.\\nThe patient group consisted of 20 subjects with allergic rhinitis showed persistent GC-resistance, resulting in a required surgical removal after the GC treatments for over 6 months.\\nResults and Conclusion: Compared to normal subjects, whereas the number of GR-\"-positive inflammatory cells was decreased, the number of GR-$positive cells was significantly increased in nasal tissues from patient group.\\nThe number of NF-0B-positive cells was at a similar level both patients and normal control.\\nMethods: 28 patients were defined as having non-allergic rhinitis by history, examination in addition to the presence of negative skin prick tests using common inhalant allergens and low total IgE using the Phadia CAP.\\nConclusion: Intranasal azelastine reduces substance P release into nasal lavage fluid of non-allergic rhinitis patients associated with clinical improvement during a 10 day treatment period.\\nPurpose: The aim of this study is to investigate potassium humate`s antiinflammatory properties in patients suffering from exacerbations of hayfever during the grass pollen season in South Africa, using clinical symptoms and signs as well as establishing changes in inflammatory markers using established and new laboratory techniques.\\nClinical symptoms were analysed after a nasal provocation test using grass pollen allergens and immunological parameters (specific immunoglobulins in serum, percentage of eosinophils in nasal washes and cytokines secreted by restimulated PBMC) were compared between the two treatment periods.\\nResults: Significant and consistently greater improvements in rTNSS were seen with FFNS than with placebo across all four studies ( Background: The safety profile of the novel enhanced-affinity glucocorticoid fluticasone furoate (FF) administered using a unique, side-actuated device has been investigated in children with perennial (PAR) and/or seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR).\\nMethods: Safety was evaluated in an integrated analysis of data from three randomised, double-blind, parallel-group studies in 1224 paediatric patients aged 2Y11 years with SAR or PAR.\\nData from the 6-week PAR study demonstrate that SC levels following administration of FFNS 110 6g were similar to those following placebo (least squared means, 0.94 vs 0.97; treatment ratio, 0.97; 95% confidence interval, 0.88, 1.07) which suggests that FFNS 110 6g is not associated with any effect on the HPA axis.\\nMethods: All children were evaluated with a validated modified Graffar\\'s socioeconomic questionnaire and an allergic rhinitis, asthma and atopic dermatitis after ARIA, GINA and Hannifin criteria; skin prick testing (ALK-ABELLO) for common food and inhalant allergens plus total IgE (ELISA), complete blood count (COULTER) and serial feces examination for ova and parasites were performed in all children.\\nBackground: Moderate/severe allergic rhinitis (MSAR) is an affection of nasal mucosa induced by allergen exposure and produced by a specific IgE mediated chronic inflammation.\\nMethods: This prospective, single-sited study randomized 50 patients with mild or moderate PAR who had substantial bilateral hypertrophy of the inferior turbinates to desloratadine (5 mg/day) or additional mometasone furoate monohydrate nasal spray (MFMNS), (2 sprays per nostril [total dose 200 6g] once daily) treatment groups.\\nResults: Of the 16 samples from patients having nasal polyps with allergic rhinitis, only one expressed a detectable level of mammaglobin A (1/16).\\nConclusion: Patients with CRS showed higher levels of FENO compared to normal controls, suggesting a diffuse airway inflammation.\\nObjective: To investigate the level of specific IgE (SIgE) of mite and cockroach in allergy patients\\' blood serum, and study their correlation.\\nMethods: Thirty-three patients who presented to our Respiratory or Allergy Clinics between October 2004 and May 2007, and tested positive of Blattella germanica allergen by both skin prick test and SIgE test, were further evaluated for allergens related to Periplaneta americana, moth and house dust mite using fluorescence enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\\nResults: In patients who showed concurrent hypersensitivity to all of studied allergens, responses to the cockroaches and moth were weak-positive (below Grade IV), with significantly lower SIgE levels than as found for house dust mite (P G 0.001).\\nThe purpose of the study is to assess the cost-effectiveness of allergy testing for patients with respiratory and/or skin problems in primary care in Italy.\\nBackground: The aim of the study is to assess the diagnostic potential of two in vitro methods for IgE diagnosis and to compare them with the skin-prick test (SPT) as a gold standard.\\nMethods: 131 patients with positive case history and SPT to grass pollen, house dust mite, moulds, bee and wasp venom suffering of bronchial asthma or allergic rhinitis /hay fever and 10 clinically health controls were studied.\\nThere was no significant correlation between electrical phrenic nerve stimulation and serum immune markers, except there was decreased action potential amplitude in SLE group with positive results for Anti DNA as14 (66.6%) of patients had Anti DNA + ve, all showed reduced amplitude of rt phrenic nerve & 13(93%) of them showed reduced amplitude of lt phrenic nerve.\\nMethods: In this parallel double-blind placebo controlled phase II study potassium humate was randomly assigned, at a dosage of 1.8g in divided doses/day, to atopic patients (n = 40) presenting with acute symptoms of hay fever.\\nIn this study, we investigated whether there are differences between cetirizine and levocetirizine in the cytokine and chemokine production by normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK).While NHEK were stimulated with interferon-,(IFN-,) and tumor necrosis factor-\" (TNF-\") cetirizine or levocetirizine was added to the experimental cultures.\\nCetirizine and levocetirizine at 10 j8 M downmodulated the expression of CD54 molecules at similar levels to each other.This study demonstrates that cetirizine and levocetirizine have comparable effects on the immunological function of keratinocytes.\\n3.3% of subjects in the CT and 9.4% in the OnD groups reported drug-related treatment-emergent AEs. Conclusion: Our study confirms previous data that, when taking a potent antihistamine, like levocetirizine, PER symptoms (including nasal congestion) are effectively controlled over a 6-month treatment period.\\nObjective and Methods: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from 41 patients with atopic dermatitis allergic to hen-egg ranging from 2 months to 2 years 10 months in age.\\nTo clarify the mode of action whereby OXM ameliorates the conditions of the children with food allergy-complicated atopic dermatitis and whether development of bronchial asthma is prevented, OXM-related alterations of the clinical symptoms and examination, seen in patients during the course of 8 months`to 6 years and 10 months`treatment was evaluated.\\nIn further study, OXM efficiently suppressed incidence of asthma to approximately 9% of the patients (control:42.9%) and both of total IgE value and peripheral eosinophils count was not elevated after OXM-treatment and were lower than those in age-matched asthma patients un-treated with OXM.\\nConclusion: OXM, which is a significant candidate for one of the therapeutic modalities against children with food allergy-induced atopic dermatitis, and based on the clinical study, was also found to be effective prophylaxis for development of childhood asthma.\\nResults: Propranolol induced a significant dose dependent cytotoxic effect on human MOLT-4 cell line in less than 10 hours compared to untreated control cells.\\nPrevious studies have shown that zinc is crucial for normal development and function of cells mediating non-specific immunity.\\nConclusion: This study showed that median value of zinc level was significantly lower and zinc deficiency was more frequently found in the patients with recurrent early wheeze compared with in age-matched controls.\\nCVID is a heterogeneous group of immunologic disorder of un known etiology, characterized by impaired antibody responses, associated with number and function cells defect including lymphopenia,anergy,impaired lymphocyte proliferation and deficit cytokine secretion that the most important of them is IL-2.most prevalent of the Objective: The goal of this study was evaluation of the clinical and paraclinical characterized 20 CVID patients,interlukine 2 production and compaired these to healthy control group.\\nMethods and Materials: We done a randomized cross sectional study in 20 CVID patients from department of immunology and allergy in children medical center and 10 healthy control.\\nConclusion: In our the study, all of the patients showed that T cells of them exhibit deficient production of IL-2 and manifestations of this deficiency were high frequency of autoimmunity,granolumatose disease, bronchectasia and recurrent infection in spite of given monthly IVIg in patients.\\nMethods: We investigated 127 adult patients with AD according to their skin colonization after treatment with antiinflammatory and antiseptic substances, medical history, severity of AD and sensitization to different allergens.\\nTo evaluate result this study, we performed histopathology examination by skin biopsy, haematology test by peripheral blood sample that obtained from cubital venous puncture, and the changes of clinical feature.\\nSo, the results of the study of cytokines in different biologic substrates (serum, urine, exhaled air condensates) in the onset of the disease showed the prevalence of immune reactions in the pathogenesis of HFRS without any dependence with the Hantavirus serotype.\\nTherefore, we investigated effects of CS on phagocytosis and antibody production, expression of surface antigens, IL-1$mRNA in AM associated with immune functions.\\nConclusion: These results suggest that the signaling pathways involved in RANTES production by murine epidermal LCs in response to different TLR stimuli are not necessarily the same, and that inhibition of p38 MAPK may be a more specific therapeutic strategy for eosinophilic inflammation in AD patients with S.\\nConclusion: A three week therapeutic seaside treatment reduces the activity of bronchial asthma and atopic eczema and markedly improves an allergic patient`s quality of life.\\nAim of this study is to determine the serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta-2 (TGF$2), interleukin-4 (IL-4), interleukin-2-receptor (IL-2R), and eosinophilic cationic protein (ECP) in acute astmatic children (AAC) and compare with acute bronchiolitis and healthy subjects and to assess the changes with treatment.\\nResults: Serum VEGF, TGF$2, IL-4 and IL-2R levels were increased in patients with AAC and bronchiolitis than in controls before therapy.\\nThe aim of this study was to determine whether asthma nurse intervention during clinical period could increase knowledge and improve self-management and whether this would influence the frequency and severity of symptoms, and pulmonary function test.\\nAim: To evaluate the connection between IgE level, CD26, CD30 expression and intracellular interferon (IFN)-, production by cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMC) and the risk of infant atopic dermatitis (AD) forming.\\nConclusion: Evidently GOS/FOS supplementation induced an anti-allergic immunoglobulin profile in infants at high risk for allergic diseases whereas desired specific immune responses were not affected indicating the potential role of oral GOS/FOS exposure for primary prevention of allergies.\\nThe results was compared with the control group of the patients without any skin disease.\\nObjective: In the study concerened low dose of IVIG was as effective as high dose in reducing the risk of infection in patients with Chronic Lymphatic Leukemia(CLL) and secondary Hypogammaglobulinaemia without the inclusion of the control group, behind the idea to assess the IVIG superiority over the empirical therapy.\\nResults: In response to IVIG there were immediate and accumulative increase in the serum IgG levels and an associated decrease in total and serious infections.\\nConclusion: Infection as the main cause of morbidity and mortality consequent upon the hypogammaglobulinaemia with the background of cell mediated immunity was associate with protracted cytotoxic drugs therapy.\\nIgA levels increased significantly with age in patients with thyrotoxicosis (PG0,01) and a similar correlation was found in the blood donor group.\\nToll-like receptor 2, 4, and 6 expression and function in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from asthma patients Background: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory lung disease that is caused by impairment of adaptive immune system like many immunologic diseases.\\nTherefore, we investigated whether the expressions of several TLRs are different in asthma patients compared to normal subjects and if so, whether the functionality of these receptors could be related to this change.\\nMethods: The expressions of TLR2, 4, and TLR6 on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from asthma patients and normal subjects were analyzed by flow cytometry.\\nResults: The expression of TLR2 was up-regulated on PBMCs from asthma patient as compared to normal subject.\\nConclusion: Our data suggest that the difference of the phonotypical expression and the functional responsiveness of TLRs might be related with pathogenesis of asthma.\\nInfluences of anti-IgE antibody omalizumab on allergen-induced airway inflammation and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in murine models of asthma Background: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of treatment with omalizumab, an anti-immunoglobulin E antibody, on allergic-airway responses in mice after inhalation of the naturally occurring aeroallergen Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) and to examine the effects of omalizumab on specific immune responses to a defined protein antigen with the use of an ovalbumin (OVA) model of asthma.\\nThese results suggest that omalizumab or similar agents given during times of antigen exposure might alter disease progression in patients with respiratory allergy.\\nResults: Der p 2 induced dose-dependent up-regulation in gene expression and protein secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and MIP-3\".\\nInterleukin 6, IL-8 (CXCL8), and Monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1/CCL2) play a pivotal role in mediating the infiltration and activation of immune cells into pathogenic lesions, including the lung and skin.\\nThe aim of this study was to examine whether the house dust mite Dermatophagoides pteronissinus extract (DpE) affects the mRNA and protein expression of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 in the human eosinophil cell line, EoL-1 by performing RT-PCR and ELISA.\\nMethods: A total of 137 patients with allergic rhinitis with/without asthma and 109 non-atopic subjects were selected and analyzed for skin reactivity (SPT), total serum IgE and specific IgE levels to both Bt-total and Bt-ConA extracts, proliferative response and cytokine (IFN-+ and IL-5) production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated with both extracts.\\nBackground and Purpose: Eosinophils are well accepted to be the most important cells in the development and maintenance of the clinical conditions of allergic diseases such as allergic rhinitis and asthma.\\nConclusion: The inhibitory effect of EP on inflammatory cytokine production from epithelial cells and on eosinophil survival contributed to its therapeutic effect on allergic airway diseases, including allergic rhinitis.\\nReduced levels of total serum IgE and FcRI expression in releaser and non-releaser basophils FcRI mediated signal pathway in basophils and mast cells leads to release of histamine and other mediators in-vitro and in-vivo systems.\\nInterestingly, basophils from 18-20% of the population do not release histamine and other mediators on activation of the IgE signal transduction pathway and this has been attributed to the absence of tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk. The present work deals with the histamine releasibility in Indian subjects to assess relationship between releasers and non releaser basophils with expression of FcRI and total serum IgE levels.Basophils from peripheral blood of healthy adults was purified by density gradient centrifugation and negative immuno-selection technique.\\nResults: HLA-DRB1*1101 was present at significantly higher frequency in AD patients compared with NC (12.4% vs 1.8%, P=0.002, OR=7.796, CI 1.775Y32.883) and was regarded as a factor associated with AD susceptibility.\\nThe study of expression of activation markers using flow cytometry in food allergy in children can be helpful in observation of the dynamic progress process, but it cannot be used as a single diagnosis test.\\nObjective: The

quality of life.\\nConclusion: Conducted research proved a valid increase in the effectiveness of supporting therapy of the BA with the combination of active treatment of the AR, which becomes apparent besides clinical improvement in an additional growth of measures of ventilating capability of lungs, level of the resistance of the bronchial tree and nasal apertures and normalization of ECP content.\\nConclusion: we can assert that the prevention usage of small doses of HRá2-IFN guarantees positive clinical effect on the pollinosis (bronchial asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis), provides for the lowering of the levels of ECP and therefore the decrease of inflammation process in the windpipe.\\nPresented findings provide evidence that PP supplementation in patients with SRA enhanced the expression of alpha GP isoforms, restore the possibility to induce IL-10 synthesis and made CD4+ T-cells more responsive to steroids.\\nMethods: 14 patients, 11 females and 3 males, were studied, age average 57 years, all of them suffering from severe allergic asthma (step V present GINA guideline) from the last 5Y37 yr, average 19 yr.\\nFor these studies constitutively GFP-expressing transgenic mice were used, which allowed the monitoring of cell specific knock-down effects.\\nBackground: Despite a number of effective pharmacological options for the prevention and treatment of the pathophysiologic responses that occur in sensitized patients on allergen exposure, the termination of allergic hypersensitivities remains an elusive therapeutic goal.\\nImmunization with this fusion protein induced in mice and rabbits protective IgG antibodies which recognized the allergen and neutralized the infection of cells expressing the receptor for human rhinoviruses.\\nAn Internet-based questionnaire study was conducted of patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and parents of children with asthma to evaluate adherence to regimens of treatment and convenience of use of inhaled and transdermal preparations.\\nResults: From the group of patients, subjected to SLIT + medical treatment, 12 (48%) were completely controlled, 9 (36%) Y partially controlled and 4 (16%) out of control for the last four weeks of the study.\\nConclusion: The results of the study suggest that SLIT affords additional benefit to medical treatment in patients with asthma and allergy to dust mites.\\nConclusion: The results of this clinical trial show that the immunotherapytreated patients, in contrast with untreated, experience a significant improvement in the overall quality of life related to asthma.\\nObjective: The aim of this study was to assess the effects of 8 weeks\\' pranlukast treatment on quality of life and pulmonary function in patients with

quality of life; reduction of T-cell activation and response to exercise stimuli.\\nIn this study the levels of lipid peroxides in the serum of asthmatic patients, whose symptoms were controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta(2)-agonists, were measured.\\nResults: After 3 months of treatment, the mean lipid peroxide concentrations were significantly higher in asthmatic patients than in the healthy controls (4.3 +/j 0.15 micromol/mL vs.\\nAdministration high doses of fluticasone propionate and decreasing dose of oral glucocorticosteroids lead to reliable increase the morning level of serum cortisol by the sixth month of treatment in both groups of patients.\\nResults: The results of the nvestigation showed statistically significant improvement of thr score symptoms with the first group:the reduction of the number of asthmatic approaches,the increase of FEV1 from (78,1T3,2) to (95,3T2,1) and a cough prevention (pG0,01).Following a 12 weeks tratmwnt,93% of the patients from the first group and 73% of the patients from the second group have not shown any side effects during the treatment period.We have notice significantly greater improvements in morning and evening peak expiratory flow of the patients from the first group.Patients from the second group needed additional therapy of short acting beta2agonist.\\nThe aim of the present study was to estimate the prevalence of anxiety disorders in outpatients with various allergic diseases, to identify diagnostic cues or possible risk factors, and to test the usefulness of self-administered questionnaire screening at the allergy clinic.\\nAim: A negative association between the number of siblings and older siblings especially with allergic diseases symptoms through the impact of infections on Th1/Th2 immune response is suggested.\\nHigh prevalence of positive immediate hypersensitivity skin test reactions in the asthmatics population is a strong argument that it should be included in the initial evaluation of patients with asthma.\\nObjective: The aim of the study was to assess sensitization to common inhalant allergens among adult patients with asthma associated with allergic rhinitis (AR) and to find a relationship with the medication and the duration of asthma/AR Methods: A screening survey questionnaire including questions assessing prevalence of symptoms of asthma over 12 months and questions relating 24 months prevalence of AR symptoms, were distributed to 763 of 16Y87 year old (median age 46 yr) patients presented in the outpatients department during of 1 years.\\nThe aim of our study was to reveal the association between C-1055T, Arg130Gln (G + 2044A) IL-13 gene polymorphism and level of total IgE in BA patients.\\nMethods: In our outpatient clinic, we studied a group of 133 patients (female: 91, male: 42; mean age: 44y) with bronchial asthma.\\nBackground: Interest in the impact of illness on day to day function is leading investigators to include both disease specific and generic health related quality of life (HR QOL) questionnaires in a broad range of clinical studies and to gain a full picture of the impact of asthma on the lives of children with this condition, it is necessary to make direct measurement of health related quality of life.\\nThe results demonstrate that a selective iNOS inhibitor 1400W is effective in improving the airways inflammations through reducing total inflammatory cell counts in the OVA-sensitized BALB/c mice.\\nMethods: 100 patients younger than 5 years old, vaccinated at birth, with variable severity of asthma were compared to the same number of ageadjusted healthy control group in a case-control study.\\nExperimental tests have shown that the severity of the disease, multiple hospitalizations and the absence of specific IgE mediated symptoms, upon exposure to allergens, could contribute to increased emotional disorders in children.\\nWe evaluated: sex, age, number of episodes before consulting, interval between first and last episode, history of atopy, time elapsed between exposure to the suspected triggering factor and the appearance of symptoms, form of presentation, severity of the reaction, treatment received and clinical/laboratory work up.\\nThe aim of the study was to evaluate the serum activity of angiotensine converting enzyme (ACE) in patients with anaphylaxis after Hymenoptera sting event depending on the polymorphism of ACE gene and specific IgE.\\nResults: The ACE gene polymorphism in the control group were: DD n=5 (21.7%), ID n=15 ( 65.2%), II n=3 (13.1%) The ACE gene polymorphism in the study group were: DD n=16 (33.3%), ID n=22 (45.85%), II n=10 (20.85%) Conclusion: In the group of patients with documented anaphylactic reaction to Hymenoptera sting there were no differences between the ACE gene polymorphism and general population.\\nConclusion: These data confirm that foods specially milk and wheat are the most common causes of anaphylaxis in children and dermatologic signs and symptoms are the most common finding, thus parents and physicians should be educated to recognize the most common causative allergens and common presenting clinical manifestation of this disease to avoid the progression of this life threatening syndrome and be able to manage anaphylactic patients.\\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between mast cell numbers and different types of periodontal diseases.\\nIn this study, we further investigated the effects of CSM on the cytokine production of mast cells respect to activation with

and eotaxin were higher in patients with OM with asthma as compared to controls.\\nConclusion: These results suggest that both cetirizine and levocetirizine at higher concentrations reduce the release of GM-CSF and IL-8 from A549 human airway epithelial cells stimulated with IL-1$.\\nResults: Numbers of V,9/V&2 T cells are lower in CBMC than those in adult PBMC while TCR expression levels were similar in both groups.\\nProduction of cytokines by blood cells and mice lungs was investigated for the 10th day after infection in reaction of IFA.\\nImmune system, in response to infective or allergic agents, makes use of different cellular populations, such as alfa/beta and gamma/delta (g/d) T cells.\\nThe latter are present in both peripheral (PB) and cord (CB) blood, being the second in a immature stage, and respond to a variety of non-peptidic antigens, through a HLA-independent system, by secreting pro-inflammatory and immunomodulant cytokines, expressing membrane receptors and costimulatory molecules, and producing cytotoxic effectors such as perforin and granzyme.\\nRecent studies have suggested that also the less common g/d T cells may play a role as effectors and immunoregulatory cells in the development and perpetuation of allergic inflammation and also in bronchial asthma, rhinitis and eczema We aimed at analysing the capability of g/d T cells derived from PB or CB to respond to non-proteic antigens, in view of a putative therapeutic use in newborn or infant pathologies.\\nBackground: Th1 and Th2 cells, resulting from antigenic stimulation in the presence of IL-12 and IL-4, respectively, are implicated in the pathology of various diseases including allergic and autoimmune diseases.\\nConclusion: In conclusion, the different behaviour of statins on the diverse kind of cells in vitro is prompting news in the studies about their use for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.\\nResults: Dog ownership in early childhood was associated with a significant lower rate of mixed pollen and inhalant sensitization but had no effect on dog sensitization and the prevalence of allergic symptoms and diseases up to age 6.\\nMethods: One hundred and twenty children aged 3Y15 years attending the allergy clinic, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, with symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinitis or atopic dermatitis, and with skin test reactivity to at least 1 allergen were enrolled.\\nMethods: Patients with asthma and/or allergic rhinoconjunctivitis attended pediatric allergy clinic, King

low-level toluene on transcription factors for T-cell differentiation, male C3H/HeN and BALB/c mice were exposed to filtered air (control), 5, 50 and 500ppm toluene by whole body inhalation for 6 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 3 and 6 weeks.\\nConclusion: This is the first study to show in vivo modulation of the expression of transcription factor genes in the different strains of mice by exposure to low-level toluene, in concert with antigenic stimulation.\\nThe proposed nested case-control study includes dwelling inspections of a non-destructive type (building checklist, sensory and visual evaluation of dampness, dust sampling for HDM, moulds, pollens, phthalates), engineering measurements (air temperature, humidity, CO2 level) and medical examinations (general examination and skin prick test).\\nMethods: We collected the data of all the immigrants referred to our allergy service within the last two years, focusing those patients without family or clinical history of allergic diseases.\\nBackground: Pertussis infection has been suspected to be a potential causal factor in the development of atopic disease because of the effect of pertussis immunization on specific IgE antibodies.\\nThe clinical history of the patients, the physical appearance of allergenic mites in higher concentration in the patients bed, positive skin test results with mite extract and identification of mite specific IgE antibodies in patients\\' sera by RAST technique established the role of dust mites on the aetiopathogenesis of bronchial asthma in developing country.\\nThese results indicates that high allergic reactivity, (evidenced by clinical, skin prick test and specific IgE), and high levels of Th1 cytokines were both been present in sera of children evaluated.\\nThe aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of low-level toluene exposure and PGN stimulation on systemic Th1/Th2 immunity in infant mice.\\nConclusion: The lack of association between MS4A2 +6960A/G polymorphism and total serum IgE levels among allergic individuals in the Filipino study population indicates that the single-nucleotide polymorphism may not directly be involved in the development of allergic disorders.\\nMethods: 2 patients with confirmed alpha-1-AT deficiency and allergic diseases and complete identification of genotype have been studied.\\nBackground: An animal model resembling the human clinical manifestations of allergy is needed for various aspects of allergy research, e.g. for investigating mechanisms and pathway of immunopathology, measuring allergenicity of a protein, testing drug and vaccine therapeutic efficacy.\\nResults: In the present study, we demonstrate that peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC) from delayed typed midge-allergic subjects proliferate and secret more interferon-!\\nResults: In the two allergic patients skin tests and serum IgE detection were positive only for yellow jacket extract.\\nBackground: Increased serum tryptase (ST) levels and Mastocytosis are described in patients with severe anaphylactic reactions after hymenoptera sting (from 7,3% to 10.5% depending on the study).\\nThese data suggest that in HB patients severe anaphylactic reactions are due to the high sIgE level and not to a larger number of mast cells which a higher ST level would indicate.\\nThe aim of our study was to determine the potential virulence of staphylococci from AD patients in bacterial skin infections and to examine the innate immune response to infection through expression of antimicrobial peptides.\\nConclusion: This study indicates that PV is an antibody-mediated disease with increase in TH2 cytokines and auto reactive T cells from PV patients produced TH2 cytokine preferentially in active stages of PV disease.\\nThe research objective was to investigate specific features of cytokine spectrum of nasal secretion, saliva and blood serum in the process of children allergic diseases development (allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, bronchial asthma).\\nMethods: The production of cytokines by alloactivated circulating mononucleated cells was assessed before and after one year of treatment in a subset of 50 patients enrolled in a one-year study.\\nTo clarify the role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of Kimura\\'s disease and the values of measuring serum levels of eosionophil cationic protein (ECP) for monitoring disease activity, a total 14 serum and 7 tissue samples from patients with Kimura\\'s disease were studied.\\nBackground: Undernutrition in children is associated with increased susceptibility to infections and depressed effect on cell-mediated and humoral immunity.\\nMethods: Twenty seven patients with definite diagnosis of LAD (based on standard criteria and laboratory tests), attending Allergy, and Immunology clinic in Children Medical Center Hospital-from 1991 to 2006 ranging in age from 3 months to 24 Years old, were studied and followed.\\nWe observed that the CD4 lymphocytes are significantly less in the studied patients and is determined lower level of CD56 bearing lymphocytes -natural killer /NK/ cells, compared to healthy controls.\\nThe levels of Phl p specific IgE were reduced to the same extent in all groups, but both the systemic-(spleen) and local (draining lymph nodes) T cell responses decreased with increased dosing intervals, indicating a positive effect of higher dosing frequency on T-cell tolerance.\\nMethods: One-hundred allergic patients were screened by history, skin tests and specific IgE levels.\\nResults: Patients getting active immunotherapy in both single as well as multiple allergen group showed significant improvement (pG 0.01) in disease state in comparison to placebo patients.\\nResults: Most of the patients\\' parents reported with good response and the pharmacotherapy drugs relatively reduced over a period of time and the symptoms drastically came down with increase PEFR.\\nConclusion: Sublingual ORAL Immunotherapy has shown excellent clinical response with significant improvement in skin prick test and ImmunoCAP RAST test results in case of Perennial Allergic Conjunctivitis due to D.farinae.This is an isolated case and much more cases need to be studied.\\nYet, so far, only one study on allergoid SLIT starting with a 4-day build-up phase to achieve in a shorter time the maximum suggested dose for the maintenance therapy was performed in 39 allergic patients with promising results.\\nConclusion: We can speculate that these positive changes in immune system of the patients of the 1 group could be the response of lymphoid tissue to the modified allergen stimulation during SIT and the anti-inflammatory effect that lead to better overcoming of the treatment.\\nConclusion: In this study on patients with single sensitization to Blomia Tropicalis allergen suffering from allergic respiratory disease, the SLIT improves the allergic symptoms to a greater extent than drug treatment.\\nAim of the present study was to identify an immunological marker that correlates with the clinical effects among CXCR3, CCR3, CXCR4, CCR5 expression on PBMC.\\nThe immunological parameters assessed were: PBMC proliferation with specific allergen Par-j1, detection of CD4, CD8, CD3 and chemokines receptors CCR3, CXCR3, CXCR4, CCR5 before and after stimulation with Par-j1 Results: The symptom scores decreased in the control group since the first week of study whereas in the SLIT group a significant improvement versus baseline was seen after 6 weeks of treatment.\\nConclusions: This study demonstrates efficacy SLIT when compared to conventional therapy for persistent asthma and rhinitis, correlations between clinical scores and both CXCR3 and CCR3 seen after 6 weeks of immunotherapy in treated patients demonstrate an immunological shift towards Th1 lymphocyte pattern.\\nIn order to develop therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of allergy to birch and related allergen sources, we immunized mice with surface-exposed peptides derived from the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1 and established 14 hybridomas secreting peptide-specific mouse monoclonal IgG1 antibodies.\\nConclusion: This open and controlled clinical study demonstrates that the patients sensitized against D.\\nMaterials and Methods: One hundred and nine patients (56 female and 53 male, mean age 29.7 years) with rhinoconjunctivitis and/or asthma, sensitised to mites and/or pollens were included in an observational cohort study.\\nResults: No significant differences were found between groups of patients before start of allergen immunotherapy in any parameter tested.\\nMethods: 33 rhinitic patients allergic to grass pollens as confirmed by clinical history, skin prick tests and specific IgE were included in the trial.\\nResults: The Lc fed Der p 2 sensitized mice showed significantly lower Der p 2 specific-IgE and IgG1 after s.c. immunizations and airway challenge compared to the NaHCO 3 buffer control group.\\nMethods: Main aim of this project, supported by IGA MZ CR No. NR8383-3/ 2005 , is to test if the level of AHR is associated with certain alleles or haplotypes of genes (ADAM 33 and STAT 6) involved in immune system activity in course of allergic illness development and airway hyperresponsiveness.\\nMethods: We have quantified the inflammation in central and peripheral airways by measuring exhaled nitric oxide (NO) at multiple exhalation flows in 42 asthmatic patients at different levels of severity (mild = 11; moderate stable = 10; moderate during exacerbation = 9; severe = 12, 6 of whom were receiving oral corticosteroids) and 15 healthy control subjects.\\nConclusion: Treatment with azithromycin significantly improved asthma symptoms and lung function indicating that Chlamydia pneumoniae may play an important role in enhancing the inflammatory processes in lower airways.\\nSixteen healthy subjects as the control group were enrolled in the study and their airway responsiveness compared with that of the CSA and CPS patients.\\nConclusion: Results of this study demonstrate that acetylcholine-induced coronary spasticity is significantly related to methacholine-induced airway responsiveness in patients with coronary spastic angina.\\nResults: Reflux disease symptoms was recorded in eighteen patients of the studied group (62%).\\nConclusion: The study results showed presence of HPS and (IPVD)among patients of chronic liver disease.\\nCirculating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a pro-inflammatory protein, are associated with increased risk for atherosclerosis.Therefore, CRP may be one of the links between OSAH and cardiovascular disease (CVD).We hypothesized that Patients with OSA have higher CRP values than do control subjects.\\nMethods and Results: We studied 28 patients (20 males and 8 females ) with newly diagnosed (OSA), who were free of other diseases, had never been treated for OSA, and were taking no medications.\\nThe cellular infiltration (total cell count and EPO activity in BALF), Th1/Th2 cytokines in BALF and spleen culture supernatant, serologic (specific IgE, IgG1) and histopathologic events in the various animal groups were compared.\\nResults: Mice challenged with active serine protease allergen or OVA showed tissue damage in the lungs, elevated serum IgE, IgG1, eosinophils and expression of inflammatory cytokines in BALF and spleen culture supernatant, indicating the induction of a Th2 response.\\nDrugs that antagonize TNF-á have demonstrated their effect controlling inflammatory activity and inhibiting the progression of structural damage on patients with chronic arthropathies.\\nEmploying newly developed ELISA, levels of IgE Abs against proteins from the Sulamit extract and one of the dominant wheat IgE binding component, \"-amylase inhibitors type 1 and 3, were quantified and shown to be significantly elevated in sera of allergic patients compared to those of healthy controls.\\nConclusion: This study characterized the spectrum of wheat components recognized by IgE Abs of allergic patients, analyzed the impact of proteins separation and digestion on immunogenicity of wheat allergens, compared the sensitivity and specificity of newly developed specific IgE ELISA assay and in vitro basophils activation test using identified allergens.\\nThe most potent cell activating component in the humanized RBL assay was cow\\'s milk which induced a relevant degranulation in 47.4% of the patients followed by goat\\'s and sheep\\'s milk (35.9 and 28.2%, respectively).\\nThe aim of the study was to determine serum concentrations of IL-4, IL-5 in patients with chronic gastritis and food allergy, who had been infected with H.\\nThe comparative analysis of IL-5 and IL5 levels between patients with food allergy and control group with chronic gastritis showed statistically significant differences (pG0.05).\\nMethods: We performed a retrospective study including 42 patients diagnosed to egg allergy in the first 2 years of life who were controlled at 3,4 and 5 years of age.\\nBackground: Animal models demonstrating IgE of the same specificity as human IgE and clinical symptoms upon challenge close to those observed in allergic patients are of great interest for the understanding of mechanisms involved in the induction and regulation of allergy.\\nConclusion: This results confirm the important role allergic mechanisms in pathogenesis of inflammatory changes in stomach mucosa observed in patients with peptic ulcer disease and food allergy.\\nResults: Part I: The conditions of hypersensitivity mice were markedly improved by the high or middle Lonicera doses, such as reduced levels of serum OVA-specific IgE , inhibited the abnormal monocular cell proliferations, alleviated the degranulation and aggregation of intestinal mast cells, increased the percentage of intact mast cells and significantly reduction of histamine release, as well as downregulated the ratio of IL-4/IFN-, and promoted the mRNA expression of IL-10 and TGF-$ in PLNMC.\\nConclusion: Our data first showed the immunological regulation effects to food allergy from the high or middle Lonicera concentrations extracted from water solution, such as anti-inflammation and immunoregulation of Th1/Th2 responses as well as activation of T regulatory cells.\\nSkin tests and serum allergen-specific IgE antibody levels correlate poorly with clinical expression of apple allergy in birch-allergic individuals.\\nThe diagnosis of latex allergy in the patients of the second group was confirmed by the positive use test (in 10 from 10 ones), the negative results of Contact Patch Test with rubber chemicals for type IV hypersensitivity and by revealing of IgE antibodies to latex in 6 from 7 sera with ELISA method.\\nConclusion: According to these results it is possible to be determined that the cow milk is present in the allergic rinitis of smaller children to the four years of age, and that his replacement could improve the clinical sintomatology of the patients with medication saving for such.\\nThe study has been performed to determine the most prevalent food allergens inducing immediate clinical reactions in different age groups of Swiss infants and children.\\nDiscussion: The results indicated that our patients with fish allergy tended to develop severe symptoms after ingestion of different kinds of fish due to sensitization to cross-reactive allergens.\\nThis study was performed to investigate the expression of nerve growth factor (NGF) messenger RNA and protein and to localize the NGF protein in the nasal mucosa of patients with perennial allergic rhinitis and control subjects.\\nWestern blotting was used to analyze differences in expression levels of NGF protein between patients with perennial allergic rhinitis and normal controls, and the NGF protein was localized immunohistochemically.\\nResults: The expression levels of NGF messenger RNA and protein in the nasal mucosa were significantly increased in patients with perennial allergic rhinitis compared with those in controls.\\nIn control group, the low level of innate immune response (TLR2 and 4, NF.Bp65, NF.Bp105/p60) was in conformity with TH2skewed (TH1 G Treg G TH2) and IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation which produce histamine and clinical symptoms.\\nIn our previous study, we identified many differences in gene expression patterns containing interferon-inducible CXC chemokine genes in fibroblasts derived from allergic (AF) and nonallergic (NF) patients, although the fibroblasts were cultured and stimulated under the same conditions.\\nTo investigate the role of the IgE immunoreactive Antigen 5 (Ag 5) in the sero-positive patients with CE, we determined Nterminal of 57 kDa subunit of Ag5 responsible for IgE and C-terminal of this active antigen related to induction of IgG specifically.\\nResults: The frequencies of sneezing, serum levels of ovalbumin-specific IgE, and degrees of inducible nitric oxide synthase expression were significantly higher in the groups locally sensitized with a mixture of ovalbumin and staphylococcal enterotoxin B or ovalbumin alone than in the negative control group or in the group locally sensitized with staphylococcal enterotoxin B alone.\\nResults: First, we found that treatment with Lactobacillus paracasei significantly elevated Th1 cytokine, IL-12 in bronchoaveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and decreased Der p-specific IgG1 in serum but there were no changes in airway hypersensitivity, influx of inflammatory cells to the lung and serum IgE level.\\nConclusion: Our results show that oral treatment with probiotics can attenuate allergic airway inflammation by increasing Th1 immune response and these effects are strain specific and dose dependent.\\nSPT reaction was studied with the relevant pollen extract on 320 respiratory allergic patients and 30% of them showed a positive response.\\nIn the present study, the effect of allergen-specific exosomes from tolerized mice on the development of allergen-induced allergic response was determined using a mouse model.\\nResults: 30 adult patients were enrolled and 26 completed the study, with 1 dropout in the active and 3 dropouts in the placebo group.\\nTwenty three allergic patients with positive skin prick test to mites from each city were selected and all of the methods for evaluation of mites and their allergens (specific antibodies of Derp and Derf, density of mites and concentrations of mite allergens) were measured.\\nThe present study evaluates the childhood and adult patients with the ARIA classification and analyzed the clinical features of each age group.\\nPathological studies of these LE types usually show prominent brain infiltrates of T-cells and patients have a poor prognosis with bad response to immunotherapy.\\nHowever, following injury or disease astrocytes become reactive, an event often characterized by over expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and the production of immunoregulatory molecules, such as cytokines, chemokines and reactive oxygen species.\\nUsing mice in which NF-kB has been selectively inactivated in GFAP expressing cells we investigated the contribution of astroglial-NF-B to CNS pathophysiology and functional recovery in models or spinal cord injury (SCI) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) .\\nFurther highlighting the importance of trans-signaling in mediating many of the CNS effects of IL-6 is the finding that inhibiting trans-signaling reduces the severity of neuroinflammatory disease induced by astrocyte-targeted IL-6 production.\\nIgG from patients with these different antibodies can passively transfer disease to mice, indicating their pathogenicity, and active immunisation is also effective.\\nThe results of the CLARITY study show that annual short-course treatment with both doses (3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg) of Cladribine Tablets led to a significant reduction in the rate of clinical relapses, disability progression and brain lesions, as well as a significant increase in the proportion of patients who remained relapse-free.\\nIn a longitudinal study on early relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, B cell survival/differentiation factors, proliferation and B cell death were measured monthly over 7 visits and their disease activity measured by EDSS (expanded disability status scale) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).\\nResults demonstrate that BAFF, APRIL and TACI mRNA are increased in untreated multiple sclerosis patients compared to healthy controls whereas cell death is lower.\\nOur previous data from gene expression and flow cytometry studies demonstrated a significantly lower expression of CX3CR1 on natural killer (NK) cells in MS patients compared with healthy individuals.\\nMore efforts are needed to associate these data with (i) gene regulatory targets in immune cells, and (ii) clinical data including disease severity and progression and therapeutic outcomes, which is both currently underway.\\nNevertheless, the use of MxA as a biological marker for IFNb treatment in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been criticized for the lack of evidence of its role on disease pathogenesis and clinical response to IFNb. Gene expression microarrays (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0) were performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 8 MS patients at baseline and after 3, 12 and 24 months of IFNb treatment.\\nSpontaneous IL-10 secretion levels of CD4+ T cells and upon stimulation with anti-CD28+MVp were significantly higher in SSPE patients than in ICON (p = 0.038 and p = 0.007, respectively).\\nThese results reflect the persistence of an IM-like humoral immune response to EBV in MS, supporting the epidemiological data on an increased risk of MS for individuals with a clinical history of IM and suggesting an unsatisfactory control of EBV infection in MS.\\nThe astrocyte associations with Toxoplasma cysts in neurons observed in this study, suggest a mechanism for cysts to affect glial cell physiology in chronic Toxoplasma infection in immunocompetant hosts.\\nSerum cytokines and chemokines like IFN-g, TNF-a, CXCL-9, CCL-4 and CCL-5 were significantly increased in MgHV infected mice at different time points post EAE induction.\\nThe absence of IL-17 production in infected mice further suggests that the disease might be triggered by different and more pathogenic T cell subsets than typical EAE.\\nRare and minute reactivation of JC virus in natalizumab long-term treated multiple sclerosis patients: A cross sectional multicenter study retardation, looking for the probable role of CMV infection in psychomotor development as an immunological mechanism involved in this process.\\nIn cultured microglial cells (MG6), glucocorticoids administration significantly suppressed the Several lines of evidence indicate that anti-aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-Ab) not only serves as a disease marker but also plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Neuromyelitis optica (NMO).\\nIn the present study, we showed that when rats are pre-treated with complete Freund\\'s adjuvant (CFA), AQP4-Ab induces its pathogenic effect in the absence of CNS antigen-specific T cells.\\nOur ex-vivo system may thus serve as a useful tool for studying how the array of signals provided by the CNS milieu induces functional changes in developing microglia, thus shedding light on the function of these cells in the healthy and diseased brain.\\nComparative analysis of gene expression profiles of microglia from demyelinative lesions in osmotic demyelination syndrome rat model ation, are associated with local inflammation or immune cell infiltration mediated by cytokines.\\nIn this study, we examined the expression of glial GJ proteins in postmortem human brain tissue from MS patients and controls kindly provided by the UK MS Tissue Bank.\\nReactive astrocytosis is defined as a hypertrophy and often hyperplasia of these cells that is associated with changes in gene expression like an increased synthesis of and cytokines.\\nThe investigation revealed that genomic ERβ as well as nongenomic acting ERs are functionally expressed on SCs. Differential stimulation of those influences basic glia cell pathways including MMP activity and myelination.\\nWe show that gamma-secretase inhibitors impair microglia activity as seen in genes expression, protein levels and migration ability which resulted in a reduction of soluble beta-amyloid (Abeta) 1-42 phagocytosis.\\nIn conclusion, the mRNA stabilizing effect of IL-1 beta in human astrocytoma cells is able to induce a very potent synergistic IL-6 expression which might have important physiological consequences.\\nIn addition, in vitro model of stroke revealed no significant induction of VEGFR-3 in activated microglial cells, indicating that infiltrating exogenous macrophages expressed VEGFR-3 after focal ischemia.\\nFifty percent of the control cells increased the expression of KIR currents (− 120 ± 26 pA at − 120 mV, n = 14) typical for early activated microglia.\\nMicroglia are CNS specific immune cells and serve as pathologic sensors responding with a complex activation process to brain damage or dysfunction.\\nMicroglia express various subtypes of nucleotide (P2X, P2Y) and adenosine (A1, A2A and A3) receptors, which control ionic conductances, membrane potential, phagocytosis, migration, gene transcription, the production of inflammatory mediators and cell survival.\\nRecent studies have shown that pathogenassociated molecular patterns significantly increase IL-33 mRNA and protein expression in the central nervous system (CNS).\\nMyelin-specific Th17 cells have been characterized as major contributors to MS pathology by infiltrating into the CNS and upon reactivation, inducing local inflammation that results in myelin destruction.\\nWe investigated the role of 3-HAA in modulating gene expression and neurotoxicity in primary cultures of human fetal brain cells.\\nWhereas an active astrocytic involvement in the physiopathology of neurodegenerative or neuroinflammatory disorders has now emerged, the glial expression pattern of estrogen receptors (ER) in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) remains undefined.\\nHowever, in both controls and patient groups, females had increased sCD14 levels compared to males (p = 0.001p = 0.013).\\nFinally, we demonstrated that the reduction in EAE disease severity in anti-EMMPRIN treated mice is associated with reduced MMP proteolytic activity at the glia limitans, the final barrier before infiltration into the CNS parenchyma.\\nMost of the present strategies for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are based on the modulation of immune response, but there is a lack of needed treatments to slow disease progression through inhibition of inflammatory and degenerative pathways within the CNS that result in demyelination, axonal damage and neuronal degeneration.\\nIn the present study we demonstrate that pharmacological regulation of glial inward rectifier potassium channel is effective to improve clinical and histological parameters in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced-mice.\\nDaily oral administration of NT-KC-003 reduces the clinical score of EAE mice, decreases microglia activation, white matter demyelinization and the area of cell infiltration and inhibits inflammatory response when compared to control animals that received vehicle.\\nIn the present study we investigated the effects of ABR-215031 on T cell-mediated autoimmunity of EAN in Lewis rats induced by inoculation with peripheral nerve myelin P0 protein peptide 180-199 together with complete Freund\\'s adjuvant (CFA).\\nThese data show that alterations occur in expression of the prostaglandin synthases and PGE2 receptors during the course of EAE in infiltrating immune cells and CNS resident cells, suggesting that these receptor-mediated pathways may modulate the inflammatory response during EAE.\\nAlso, using tissue from MS patients, we confirmed by immunohistochemistry the abundance of such perivascular CD123+ pDCs within acute MS lesions, closely associated with microvascular BBB-ECs. These results suggest that this novel population of BBB-associated pDCs play an anti-inflammatory role in the CNS and are present within MS lesions.\\nWe found that bone marrowderived macrophages and microglia were stimulated to express higher levels of genes related to M1 polarization, such as IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-12 and iNOS at the mRNA and protein levels, in SOCS3−/− cells compared to WT mice upon LPS, IFN-gamma or LPS plus IFN-gamma stimulation.\\nOur study suggests that SOCS3 is an important negative regulator of macrophage/microglia inflammatory responses, specifically in the EAE model.\\nIn a previous study using transgenic mice where NF-kB is specifically inhibited in astrocytes (GFAP-IkBadn, TG), we showed a reduction in the production of cytokines/ chemokines such as CCL2 and CXCL10 by astrocytes, a smaller lesion site, increased white matter preservation and improved locomotor function 8 weeks following SCI.\\nSurprisingly, we found the largest number of differentially regulated genes (994) at 6 weeks post-injury with genes involved in inflammatory/immune responses, chemotaxis, axonal growth, and cell death, all processes that may influence functional recovery.\\nWe also found significant changes in RNA and protein levels of TLR2 and the number of CD11b+ cells suggesting an altered innate immune response in the TG mice.\\nWe found that there were significant increases in mRNA expression of IL-18, while IL-18BP expression was decreased in AD patients, as compared with those of healthy controls.\\nThese results suggest that neuropeptides may play an important role in chemotaxis and the clearance of Aβ and modulate the brain response to neuroinflammatory processes such as the release of inflammatory factors from microglial cells.\\nOSM disrupted the blood-brain barrier and induced a local inflammatory response, characterized by an upregulation of adhesion molecules, MHCII expression and infiltration of T-cells and macrophages in the otherwise healthy CNS.\\nWhen EAE was induced in mice with a local expression of OSM in the striatum, disease incidence and clinical symptoms were significantly reduced.\\nMoreover, OSM induced a shift in cytokine profile of EAE-animals as analysed by means of Q-PCR, while our in vitro studies show that OSM reduces NO-production by activated macrophages.\\nWe investigated whether PD-L1 and PD-L2 are expressed by human primary CNS cells (astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, neurons, brain endothelial cells (HBECs)) under basal and inflammatory conditions using cytokine treatments (IFN-gamma, TNF, IL-1beta).\\nHowever, inflammatory cytokine treatments increased the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on these cells, especially PD-L1 on astrocytes and microglia, and PD-L2 on HBECs. Blocking PD-L1 using specific siRNA expression in astrocytes led to a significant enhanced alloreactive CD8 T cell responses (proliferation and cytokine production) showing the capacity of human glial cells to modulate CD8 T cell responses via PD-Ls. Moreover, the expression of PD-L1 was analyzed using immunohistochemistry in post-mortem brain tissues from MS and controls.\\nHigher expression of PD-L1 was detected in MS brain sections compared to controls which colocalized with astrocyte or microglia specific cell markers.\\nOur results demonstrate that PD-L1 and PD-L2 although barely expressed by human brain cells both in vitro and in vivo, are significantly boosted in an inflamed environment like the one observed in MS lesions.\\nFurthermore, while a single vaccination with Abeta resulted in upregulation of the phagocytic markers triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells-2 (TREM2) and signal regulatory protein-beta1 (SIRPbeta1) in the brain, it caused downregulation of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6.\\nTGF-β signalling in myeloid cells during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is crucial for the entrance into the remission phase Trogrlic Ivana ⁎ , Malipiero Ursula, Ackermann Friederike, Suter Tobias, Fontana Adriano University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland TGF-beta is a potent regulatory cytokine with diverse effects on hematopoietic cells and it has an important role in controlling autoimmunity.\\nIn T cell-mediated autoimmunity, mostly studied on the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model (EAE), it has been shown that TGF-beta is increased during the remission phase.\\nUnexpectedly, the phenotype was not associated with more prominent expression of iNOS, TNF-alpha and IL-1beta in Mph, DCs or microglia derived from TGFbRII knockout mice, but rather with the accumulation of the myeloid cells in the CNS of the phag-TGFbRII−/− animals in the late phase EAE.\\nActivation markers for these cells were also not differently expressed compared to littermate controls.\\nDescriptive studies in brain tissue from Alzheimer patients and the according animal models revealed high levels of the chemokine CXCL10 arguing for an important role of this chemokine in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD).\\nIn vitro, the phagocytosis assay data indicated an increased uptake of FAM-labelled fibrillar amyloid-beta 1-42 for microglial cells isolated from APP/PS1/CXCR3−/− mice compared to controls.\\nIn the presence of IFN-gamma, BV-2 cells increased iNOS and NO levels which indicated classical activated phenotype and drastically increased gp91phox and p22phox (another subunit of NADPH oxidase), but not or decreased in the presence of gp91phox containing NADPH oxidase expressed in classically activated like microglia promotes ROS formation and has an important role on brain damages after TBI.\\nOur aim was to study the effect of edelfosine on the immune system in the context of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis.\\nOur results imply that edelfosine may ameliorate EAE by acting on disease-specific immune cells, possibly via apoptosis induction.\\nAnalysis of cerebral cortex revealed significantly increased activated NF-kB p65 levels at 48 and 72 hours, while in spleen, there were no significant differences between control and DKA mice.\\nTo study the relative contribution of CD8 and CD4 T-cells and their cooperation in CNS autoimmunity, we have developed a mouse model in which hemagglutinin (HA) is expressed as a neo-self antigen in neurons (CamK-HA mice).\\nIn a previous study, we have shown that thiopalmitoylation of encephalitogenic T-cell epitopes of central nervous myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), as occur naturally in vivo, enhanced immune responses as well as the development and chronicity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of the human inflammatory demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis (MS) (1, 2) .\\nThese results suggest that the immune response induced by endogenous thioacylated peptides that are released during myelin breakdown may play a role in the development and chronicity of autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating diseases.\\nThese results indicate that differential induction of the \"efficacious\" regulatory T cells by individual dominant self-peptide for \\'tuned suppression\\' is relevant for pathogenesis leading to different clinical course and prognosis and also for treatment of autoimmune diseases.\\nTumor necrosis factor (TNF), a pleiotrophic cytokine involved in normal brain function, is associated with the development of inflammation following both traumatic injury and neurological diseases.\\nIn the present study we have demonstrated the effect of immunopurified antibodies from EL patient plasma and recombinant enzymes (autoantigens) on neuronal cell function.\\nTherefore, we are developing an animal model of these disorders by passive transfer of EL patient IgGs or active immunization with group A streptococcus homogenate, human basal ganglia and recombinant proteins (autoantigens).\\nIn addition, while chronic stress induced anxiety-like behaviors, weight loss and reduced frequency of T cells in both genders, male mice showed an exacerbate form of the disease following exposure to chronic stress.\\nAlthough this may be because of differences in disease pathogenesis, the vast majority of studies in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models of MS examine prophylactic, treatment regimes.\\nWe present our results on the alterations in the expression of the cAMP-specific PDE4 and of several inflammatory cytokine mRNAs in the brain and spinal cord of C57BL6 EAE mice model by neuroanatomical techniques (double in situ hybridization histochemistry and immunohistochemistry), and quantitative real time RT-PCR.\\nIt was originally identified through its ability to cleave into a soluble form, TNF-a, a major immunomodulatory cytokine involved in central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).\\nOur group has also demonstrated that ADAM17 expression is up-regulated in inflammatory macrophages, endothelial and astrocytic cells in spinal cord WM of rats with EAE.\\nOur results suggest that FKN/CX3CR1 is involved in EAE through migration of immune cells into the spinal cord, and in EAE-induced allodynia through microglia activation.\\nOur data suggest that TLR2, 4, 9 and MyD88 expression in CNS correlates with the appearance of clinical signs of EAE, whereas interferon-β-inducing TLR3 signaling contributes to the resistance to disease.\\nMicroRNAs (miRNA) are short non-coding single-stranded RNA molecules that modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by degradation or translational repression of target mRNAs. They play a role in physiologic development, cell differentiation and proliferation but also in pathologic conditions like autoimmune disorders including lupus and MS.\\nThe alterations in miRNA and mRNA target expression in demyelinating lesions of NMO patients compared to controls suggest that miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of NMO.\\nWe investigated global gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 23 RR-MS patients and 22 healthy individuals.\\nIntense immunosuppression followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a potential treatment option in a subset of patients suffering from multiple sclerosis (MS), a presumably autoaggressive immune disease of the central nervous system.\\nSeveral gene expression analyses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MS patients have shown strong differences in the expression of immune genes compared to healthy controls.\\nAims: To compare CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells from MS patients and healthy donors by gene expression analysis and epigenetic profiling.\\nAnalysing gene expression in CD34+ cells from MS patients did not reveal significant deviation in immune genes previously reported in MS.\\nThe objective of this study is the inference and characterization of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network in multiple sclerosis (MS) and in the antigen mediated immune cell response.\\nThe aim of the present investigation was to study an association of the immune response genes polymorphisms, which mainly code cytokine network components, with the early clinical features (first remission duration, FRD, and symptoms at onset), which may provide predictive value.\\nAdvances in human genome knowledge, along with new systematic search tools, suggest the involvement in the autoimmunization process of some gene products central to T-cell tolerance induction or lymphocyte activation.\\nOur study aimed at replicating candidate genes recently reported to be associated with MS, in our collection of samples from 4 different cohorts across Spain (Andalucía, Bilbao, Madrid and San Sebastián) totaling N2500 MS patients and N2900 healthy controls.\\nResults shown that PS did not induce significant changes either in proliferative response in vitro or in antibody levels after immunization in vivo, but lead to a Th2/Th1 imbalance.\\nEvidence from several research groups suggests that there may be immune abnormalities present in some people with schizophrenia (PwS), including alterations in T cell distribution and circulating cytokine levels, and the presence of autoantibodies directed against the brain.\\nA fourteen day injection of DEZ followed by an exposure to the acute OF resulted in a decrease in the spleen percentage number of NK cells (7.14 ± 1.75%; p b 0.01/mean ± SD) and subpopulation of TCD4+ lymphocytes (43.08 ± 4.51%; p b 0.01) in the non-divided into HRs and LRs as compared to their saline controls (10.41 ± 2.65%; 52.02 ± 8.48% for NK and TCD4+, respectively).\\nThe results obtained suggest that individual differences in locomotor activity in novelty play the important role in immune effects of desipramine influences during OF stress-induced behavioral depression.\\nTherefore, the ultimate goal of our studies is to identify how IL7R alpha is functioning through specific cell populations in the EAE disease setting, which can then be applied to therapeutic strategies and translated to the clinical setting.\\nOur studies show that systemic blockade of IL7R alpha via neutralizing antibody after disease onset promoted a significant decrease in EAE severity and lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system, which was accompanied by an increase in the resident microglia population.\\nFurther, we have shown that exosomes are able to suppress the activation of myelin-specific T cells measured by a reduction in proliferation and interferon-gamma expression.\\nWe have shown that induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in MIF-deficient mice results in reduced clinical signs and CNS inflammatory infiltrates relative to wild type controls.\\nMIF is expressed by many cell types in the CNS including infiltrating macrophages and resident microglia, suggesting that MIF may enhance the inflammatory environment of MS lesions.\\nOur data further show that MCAM antibodies can influence the proportion of activated CD4 +CD45RO+expressing IL-17 and IFN-g as compared to control, and that MCAM neutralization restricted the migration of inflammatory lymphocytes across human BBB-ECs. Our data indicate that MCAM is expressed by both BBB-ECs and by a subset of IL-17-expressing effector memory CD4 lymphocytes, and is a potential adhesion molecule for Th17 entry in the CNS of MS patients and that MCAM engagement influences IL-17 and IFNg release or production.\\nThe multiplicity of potential primary target antigens in MS, together with the likely possibility of \\'epitope spread\\' whereby the pathogenic autoimmunity can expand to other myelin target antigens in the same patient, with disease progression, suggest that MS can be associated with complex pathogenic anti-myelin autoimmunity, imposing major difficulties for devising immune-specific therapeutic approaches for MS.\\nHere, we present a novel model for chronic \"complex\" EAE associated with well defined multiple pathogenic anti-myelin autoreactivities induced in (SJL/JxC57Bl/6J)F1 mice by immunization with the \"mouse multi-epitope encephalitogenic protein\" (mMEP), a protein product of synthetic gene encoding in tandem only the disease-related epitopes of MBP, PLP, MOG, MOBP and OSP.\\n\"Complex\" EAE induced by mMEP is associated with pathogenic autoreactivities against multiple myelin antigens that result in severe chronic clinical manifestation, accompanied by massive inflammation, extensive demyelination and neuronal damage in the CNS and the optic nerve.\\nCx32 expression remained slightly upregulated with increasing protein levels compared to controls, while Cx47 showed no significant changes.\\nOur study shows distinct alterations in the expression of major oligodendrocytic and astrocytic GJ proteins at different stages of inflammatory demyelination, and suggests that GJ proteins may be differentially involved in this process.\\nWe show a remarkable level of interconnectedness among a subset of MS susceptibility loci: some of these loci affect RNA expression within other susceptibility loci and, more striking, multiple different loci have a broad effect on signaling pathways that are critical for T cell function and proliferation.\\nTo identify differentially expressed proteins in the brain stem of EAE-animals and control rats in different stages of the disease, a quantitative study by two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) was performed.\\nIn conclusion, our results indicate that microglial cells may regulate the dynamics of lymphocyte subpopulations and may be involved not only in leading the resolution of the pathological process, but also in the induction of the subsequent tolerance characteristic of this model of EAE.\\nSince we have confirmed selected gene expression results at the protein and functional level, we suggest that in addition to a microglia phenotype involved in clearance a specific microglia phenotype that supports the remyelination process exists.\\nFor the purpose of this study we employed a number of molecular methods focusing on the expression and interactions of IRF-1 and caspase 1 in MS and EAE tissues and cell cultures.\\nWhile myelin-specific T cells are present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of both healthy controls and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, they only become pathogenic in MS patients, suggesting that MS T cells are predisposed to autoreactive activation.\\nTo investigate the role of miRs in predisposing to MS, we determined the miR profile of naïve CD4 T cells of healthy, relapsing/remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) and primary progressive (PPMS) individuals with a real-time PCR Taqman Array assay that covers 95% of all described human miRs. More than 25 miRs were found to be significantly different in MS compared to healthy controls.\\nMicroarray gene-expression analysis (Affymetrix U133A-2 array) was applied to study peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) signatures of 123 relapsing-remitting MS patients: 89 patients in remission (age 36.18 ± 11.6 years, disease duration 7.1 ± 7.9 years, F: M 53:36, EDSS 1.8 ± 1.3), 34 patients in acute relapse (age 34.1 ± 8.4 years, disease duration 6.0 ± 4.1 years, F:M 25:9, EDSS 3.2 ± 1.3) compared with data from 41 healthy subjects (age 35.5 ± 8.8 years, F: M 21:20).\\nAlthough undetectable under physiological conditions, both Lcn2 mRNA and protein levels were highly induced by either LPS injection or WNV infection in choroid plexus epithelium, endothelial cells and microglia in the brain of C57BL/6 mice.\\nAlthough the CNS expression of various cytokine, chemokine and other inflammation-associated genes was increased in the brain following systemic LPS injection, there was no significant difference in these or markers of iron-metabolism in WT control versus Lcn2 KO mice.\\nOur recent work, using animal models of MS and spinal cord contusion, as well as human in vitro, in situ and ex vivo analyses revealed that these new BBB candidate proteins, including ALCAM, the Hedgehog pathway, ninjurin-1 and MCAM are involved in the regulation of immune cell trafficking across vascular structures of the CNS.\\nOur recent data, based on proteomic analysis of human BBB-associated lipid raft membrane microdomains, identified novel adhesion molecules involved in the recruitment of specific immune cell subsets to the CNS.\\nMoreover, we have identified that the interaction of activated T-cells with brain endothelial cell cultures leads to a reduction of P-gp expression and function through regulation of the NF-kB signalling route (Kooij et al., J Autoimmun 2009).\\nInhibition of leukocytevascular interactions either with blocking antibodies, or in mice genetically deficient in functional PSGL-1, dramatically reduces seizures and leads to a significant decrease in neuronal cell loss.\\nOur peptide vaccines targeting EGFRvIII have led to nearly universal generation of EGFRvIII-specific immune responses, eradication of EGFRvIII-expressing tumor cells and an apparent prolongation in progression-free and overall survival.\\nIn these trials we have been able to increase immune responses to pp65 based on tetramer analysis, but the induction of polyfunctional T cell responses has proven difficult as patients with GBM appear to have immunologic deficits specific to pp65.\\nMore recently, we have identified a dramatic ability to enhance this immune response with temozolomide-induced lymphodepletion, but have also seen that temozolomide actually increases regulatory T cell levels.\\nWe have shown in both animal and human studies that CD25 antibodies can deplete regulatory T cells and these results are associated with dramatic prolongations in PFS patients with GBM.\\nThus, favorable as well as potentially unfavorable changes in age-related gene expression and associated phenotypes were elicited by different strengths of anti-tumor T cells against gliomas.\\nThe mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), was used to study the functional role of VAP-1 in the development of CNS inflammation.\\nThis system allows us to study new potential therapeutic targets to block entry of specific human immune cells across hBBB-ECs in order to reduce neuroinflammatory processes.\\nIn this investigation, we decided to examine, using real-time quantitative PCR, the expression pattern of CB2 in immune cells from patients with active MS, as well as the effect of interferon beta therapy on CB2 expression.\\nFurthermore, we observed that interferon beta therapy induced a significant and progressive decrease of CB2 expression in those cells.\\nThe differential expression of CB2 mRNA in MS patients points to a relevant role of the cannabinoid system in the immune response in this disease.\\nThese results show that immune complexes formed in the brain can induce inflammation and behavioural changes that are initiated by FcRs. Therefore, in addition to a direct attack on neuronal cells, brain-specific (auto) antibodies, can recruit and activate microglia through their activating FcR, resulting in a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines which induce neuronal damage.\\nThe aim of the present work was to study the possible positive effects of a special nanopulse treatment (only possible with the technology of the medical instrument Pulsarion®) in several behavior and immune function parameters in old mice.\\nTo elucidate the isoform-dependent effects of apoE on EAN, we used human apoE 2, 3, and 4 transgenic (Tg) mice immunized with P0 peptide 180-199 to induce EAN, along with macrophage culture, T cell proliferation test, flow cytometry and ELISA, etc.\\nWe evaluated the effects of a non-psychoactive cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE murine model of multiple sclerosis (MS) and determined the mechanisms underlying these properties, specifically in microglial cells.\\nUsing the BV-2 mouse microglial cell line and lipopolysaccharide to induce inflammatory response, we were screening for intracellular mechanisms that might be involved in the CBD anti-inflammatory activity.\\nIn conclusion, we observed that CBD exerts anti-inflammatory activities in vivo (using the in EAE model of MS) as well as in vitro (using microglial cells).\\nThus, we performed an extensive immunophenotypic and functional analyses of MBP-stimulated T lymphocytes in 10 BMS, 15 RR-MS, 10 SP-MS and 10 PP-MS patients, comparing the results to those obtained in a group of healthy controls (HC).\\nResults showed that trascriptional factors and cytokines associated with the activity of TH17 and TH9 cells are significantly upregulated in RR and SP-MS patients whereas PP-MS is associated with an increase of TH1-associated markers alone.\\nData herein reinforce the pivotal role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of MS, for the first time show that different patterns of disease are associated with the activation of different T helper cell subsets, and offer an explanation for the biological and clinical peculiarities of PP-MS (TH1 vs.\\nInterferon gamma-induced M1 classically activated macrophages are main effector cells in acute infections with bactericidal functions via production of reactive oxygen species.\\nIL-25 (IL-17E), a new member of the IL-17 family of cytokines, promotes Th2 response in an EAE chronic mouse model and regulates the development of autoimmune inflammation mediated by IL-17producing T cells (Th17).\\nBut despite these results, mIL-25-HAlentivirus gene therapy had no effect on clinical and pathological features of EAE, evaluated respectively as disease clinical score and number of inflammatory infiltrates, percentual of axonal and myelin damage in spinal cord sections.\\nIn conclusion, our data suggest that, unlike data in EAE chronic mouse model, IL-25 gene delivery in RR-EAE SJL mice has no effects on clinical and pathological features of the disease, even if IL-25 is able to exert its biologic functions.\\nInflammatory cytokines, e.g. interleukin 18 (IL-18), produced mainly by activated microglia in the brain, can have an important role in nerve cell degeneration e.g. by enhancing production of plaque.\\nOur earlier studies showed that IL-18 colocalizes with plaques and NFT containing neurons, and IL-18 can induce expression of kinases involved in hyperphosphorylation of Tau. In this study, we examined the effects of IL-18 on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing enzymes in neuron-like differentiated human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, and generally, evaluated the role of IL-18 in plaque formation.\\nThe IL-18 treated neuron-like SH-SY5Y cells showed increased protein levels of Presenilin-1 (PS-1) and beta-Amyloid cleaving enzyme BACE-1 after the 24 h or 72 h treatments compared to the untreated controls.\\nPreliminary results for other microglial markers suggest no significant changes in the level of IgG and complement C1q, and a decrease in the expression of both Fc(gamma)RI and II in iAD cases compared to AD control cases.\\nLeukocyte recruitment coincided with emergence of microglial and macrophage subpopulations that expressed high levels of CD86 and MHC Class I in aged APP/PS1-Tg mice, and was consistent with immunohistochemical stainings showing CD45+ leukocyte-like cells in post-mortem brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer\\'s disease.\\nMicroglia, the immune cells of the CNS that mediates inflammatory immune response responding to neuronal damage, have been shown to release microparticles, containing cytokines such as IL-1, after ATP stimulation.\\nIn line with this, we have recently shown that peripheral T CD4+ cells, which invade the brain in PD patients and in MPTP-treated mice (an experimental model of PD), actively participate to neuronal cell death suggesting that therapeutic strategies aimed at preventing lymphocyte extravasation may be of interest (Brochard et al., JCI, 2009 ).\\nThe present study was designed to determine whether these or an additional 14 inflammatory mediators significantly differ in their brain levels and cellular expression between AD patients with mutations in the presenilin (PS1) gene (N=6) versus the more common sporadic disease (N=6) and to determine any relationship with the two pathologies.\\nInterestingly, our data and studies by others have shown that IFNg −/− and IFNgR −/− mice with EAE suffer increased neurological severity compared to wild type controls.\\nTo examine if this is the case, we induced EAE in irradiation bone marrow chimeric mice in which IFNgR is absent in the CNS but present in peripheral immune cells and vice versa.\\nIn the current study YKL-40 transcription and expression were evaluated in a variety of acute and chronic human neurological conditions as well as animal models of traumatic brain injury and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).\\nFurther analysis revealed that major features of macrophage function such as cytokine and chemokine expression, NO production and MHC class II surface levels are strongly affected by liposomal GCs. Consequently, specific deletion of the GR in myeloid cells also partially impaired EAE therapy by liposome-encapsulated, but not by free GCs. Liposome-encapsulated GCs had similar side effects on certain parameters of liver metabolism as compared to higher doses of free GCs, indicating that the new formulation may not reduce all adverse effects of GC therapy.\\nTo determine if E6070 can affect the induction of Th1 and Th17 cells in MOG-EAE model, splenocytes from MOG-immunized mice were activated in vitro with MOG peptide.\\nHistopathological examination of the spinal cords at the end of the treatment period revealed that both inflammatory cell infiltration and microglial activation were significantly reduced in ELND002-treated groups compared to the vehicle group.\\nFurthermore S-palmAPL induced stronger proliferative responses than APL, induced greater numbers of regulatory T cells (N15% difference), and induced a 10-fold increase in the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) compared to APL alone.\\nGenetic engineering of a soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 selective TNF with membrane TNF mimetic activities Multiple sclerosis is characterized by an autoimmune response against oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in demyelination and consecutive neurodegeneration.\\nIn addition, we demonstrated that anti-AβN11(pE) antibodies inhibited AβN11(pE)-induced cytotoxicity in IMR-32 differentiated neuroblastoma cells, and recognized naturally occurring amyloid aggregates present in brain samples from AD patients.\\nUnderstanding the antigenic and immunogenic properties of mimotopes selected in this study may help to elicit B-cell response mimicking anti-AβN11(pE) one, which will represent a promising immunotherapeutic approach for the disease treatment and/or prevention.\\nThroughout the study in all patients we have assessed immune responses in the skin, lymph nodes and peripheral blood immune cells.\\nWe analysed (i) neurotrophin production by ELISA of supernatants; (ii) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secretion by intracellular flow cytometry; (iii) the expression of growth factor mRNA by semi-quantitative RT-PCR of separated cell populations and (iv) the functional effect of PBMC conditioned media on in vitro rodent neuronal and oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) cultures.\\nAims: To investigate the expression of P2X7R, IL-1beta and ectoapyrase CD39 on peripheral blood monocytes of MS patients and to see whether Glatiramer Acetate (GA) therapeutic effects in MS may be possibly mediated by mechanisms interfering with the ATP/P2X7R interaction and hence with the induction of IL-1beta or with the ATP activity modulating CD39.\\nResults: No actual differences were found in P2X7R, IL-1beta and CD39 expression between patients and controls.\\nClinical trial data suggest that treatment with a statin can reduce the risk for developing new brain lesions in patients with CNS demyelinating disease.\\nSimilarly, during the chronic phase of TMEV infection, the levels of clinical signs and demyelination of mice treated with resveratrol during the late stage were greater than control, despite reduced IL-17A production resulting from resveratrol treatment.\\nDecrease of Th17 cells along with clinical improvement after treatment with rituximab has been reported in a patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis.\\n1 The purpose of this study was to characterize the genome-wide transcriptional effects of subcutaneous interferon-beta-1a (IFN-beta) treatment in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), and to identify expression signatures that correlate with individual clinical outcomes.\\nBy using Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 DNA microarrays, we obtained for 12 MS patients expression levels of peripheral blood mononuclear cells before (baseline), as well as two days, one month, one year and two years after start of IFN-beta therapy (Rebif, Merck Serono).\\nHowever, there are remarkable expression differences between the patients: I) After two days and one month into therapy, only eight patients showed an increase of IFN-beta-responsive genes.\\nIn this present study we have shown that each member of the whole family of human small heat shock proteins is therapeutic when EAE mice are treated at the peak of disease.\\nUsing a peptide-based structure-function approach, we have found that this therapeutic function is dependent on the molecular chaperone ability of sHSPs. Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) is accompanied by β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation and neuronal cell death in the brain of patients.\\nOur co-culture results show that T cells cocultured with DMF treated DCs express lower level of encephalitogenic markers, namely IFN-g and T-bet.\\nOur results demonstrate that DMF pre-treatment reduced neuronal damage by 30% and improved behavioral outcomes as compared to the vehicle-treated mice, indicating possible neuroprotective effects of DMF.\\nResults: In the CNS of mice with either relapsing-remitting or chronic EAE, T-cells and activated microglia expressed IL-17, with apparent localization within regions of myelin loss.\\nHowever, when emulsified in the QS21 adjuvant, the A-beta vaccine induced meningoencephalitis in about 6% of AD patients during a phase I clinical trial; presumably resulting from a pathogenic activation of the immune system against A-beta.\\nMyelin peptide-loaded matDC induced proliferation of autologous T cells obtained from MS patients, thus confirming the specificity of the assay.\\nThis study shows that antibodies from patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis activate complement, and that deposits of complement are detectable in the tumor but not in the brain.\\nWhen IL-12 was added to the cultures this proinflammatory cytokine clearly inhibited Blimp-1 expression both in CD4+ and in CD8+ T cells, in RRMS patients and in HS, even in presence of high dose of IL2.\\nKeywords: K+ channels, Kaliotoxin, Nervous system, Inflammation, Endocrine function Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), with a well-characterized animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).\\nRegulation of disease was associated with modulation of APC function as well as decreased MOG-specific CD4+ T cell responses.\\nOur results demonstrate that CNS-specific CD8+ T cells have an important regulatory role in MS, which is a disease of perturbed immune regulation.\\nThese results demonstrate that chronic astroglial IL-17A synthesis in the CNS induces astrocytosis and microglial activation but not severe tissue damage nor directly promotes the infiltration of hematogenous cells.\\nThe aim of the study was to evaluate the peripheral blood natural killer cell cytotoxicity (NKCC) and plasma levels of two cytokines playing a crucial role in regulatory mechanisms of NKCC: interleukin 2 (IL-2) and interleukin 12 (IL-12) during stress in pigs of different, genetically based, stress vulnerability.\\nOur results show cell bound components of the activated complement cascade on cells incubated with high titer AQP4-IgG positive samples, but not in healthy controls or patients with multiple sclerosis.\\nTo address the differences in pathogenesis between MS and NMO patients, it is important to compare inflammatory events occurring in the systemic circulation as well as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during relapse and active disease states.\\nIn peripheral blood of patients with NMO, the CD8+CD11asuppressor cell population was significantly decreased as compared to the MS group (2.9% vs.\\nTo assess the relevance of anti-AQP4 in lesion formation in optic nerves and the spinal cord, all data obtained from patients with spinal or optic-spinal MS (n = 4) and the NMO patients (n = 7) were compared, which indicated that antibody positivity contributed to decreases in both Th1 and Th2 cells in the CSF.\\nTaken together our results suggest that IL-10, released during the immune response in a time and antigen dependent manner, may regulate GnRH neuron functions by inducing ERK1/2 phosphorylation, thereby contributing to the integrity of the HPG axis.\\nWe investigated the effect of Natalizumab on serum sVCAM-1 levels, measured by ELISA, in MS patients (95 samples) compared to various control groups including ten healthy persons, and untreated as well as interferon-beta treated MS patients (103 samples).\\nIn a subset of patients and controls VLA-4 expression was measured by fluorescence activated cell sorting on lymphocytes and monocytes.\\nBoth mechanisms may be involved in the reduced cell trafficking into the CNS leading to clinical effect of Natalizumab but also to the rare albeit evident adverse event of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy observed in MS patients during this treatment.\\nMultiple Sclerosis (MS) patients have elevated percentages of blood T cells expressing CCR5 compared with healthy controls, suggesting that this genetic polymorphism could modulate disease susceptibility or progression.\\nObjectives: (i) To confirm the HSP70i differential gene expression between MS patients and HD by using real-time PCR, and (ii) to study the HSP70i putative role in MS pathogenesis.\\nHSPA1A (HSP70i) gene expression was determined by real time-PCR in both fresh and frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients and HD.\\nIn contrast to previous results, HSP70i expression in fresh PBMC from RRMS patients was significantly increased compared with HD (n = 30 per group; fold change = 2.5; p = 0.036).\\nHowever, HSP70i gene expression increase in RRMS patients was not associated with changes in the protein expression in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and monocytes.\\nSince the recruitment and activation of these cells is regulated mainly by IL-12p35, IL-23p19, and IL-17, as constitutes of the Th1 and the Th17 response, we have used gene-targeted mice deficient for the mentioned cytokines to understand their sequential impact and kinetics in adaptive and innate immune processes during the course of abscess development and resolution.\\nImmune cells from adult PAM mice, with altered stress-related behavioral, show an inflammatory stress response to gliadins, which could lead to a higher risk of developing CD.\\nWe show that, upon maturation, mDC of MS-patients display significant lower expression levels of MHC class II, costimulatory and migratory molecules as compared to mDC of healthy controls.\\nIndeed we found that T cells from autoimmune mice express different lineage-specific nuclear transcription factors in the first hours upon activation suggesting that data produced in the past should be revisited according to this concept of mixed identity.\\nCytokine production and co-stimulatory protein expression in DCs could be influenced by specific components of the gut microbiota, which together with gliadins may also influence their interaction with effector T-cells and the polarization of the immune response.\\nIn vitro CRYAB activates human microglia inducing an immune-regulatory phenotype typified by production of IL-10, TGF-beta and TNF-alpha, and suppression of IL-12, consistent with the previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects of sHSPs in animal models.\\nIn the present study we describe the presence of CRF, UCN1, 2 and 3 in FLS from OA and RA patients, expressed at mRNA and protein levels, detected by real time PCR, enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunocytochemistry.\\nMS patient-derived FcR-expressing gamma delta (gd) Tcells have been shown to exert antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), and the frequency of this subset of gd T-cells increases with MS progression.\\nPrevious studies showed an increment in the Arg-I activity in spleen MDSCs and their immunosupressor role on T cells in cancer, infections and the relapsing phase of EAE.\\nOur results indicate the presence and density of Arg-I+ cells in EAE mice is parallel to the different disease periods.\\nOur data show the important role played by MDSCs in the transition from the relapsing to the remitting phase of MS, by immunosuppression of T cells, which favours the anti-inflammatory response and, subsequently, the relative recovery within the disease.\\nCells were treated in vitro with pro-inflammatory cytokines for 24 h, followed by quantitative real-time PCR to determine PAD2 and PAD4 mRNA expression.\\nHere we analyzed whether uptake of apoptotic autologous blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) affect the maturation and activation of human monocyte-derived DC and describe their immunostimulatory capacity and compared different methods to induce apoptosis.\\nAltogether these results suggest that the magnitude/strength of CD4+ T cell responses to Aβ is controlled by both MHC-dependent and -independent factors in mice, the latter including the overall ability to develop Aβ-specific Treg cell responses.\\nWe found that the expression level of MMP-9 as well as its activity as measured by zymography were significantly higher in this subset than that in any other T cell subset.\\nTaken together, we found that CD8+ T effector cells have only a minor pathogenic potential in MOG-induced EAE even in lymphopenic hosts, which is shown by low-level clinical disease even in the presence of profuse CD8+ T cell infiltrates in the CNS.\\nDespite the role of dopamine (DA) in the central nervous system has been well characterized, recent studies have revealed that some immune cells, such as T-cells, express dopamine receptors (DARs).\\nAs a functional analysis of T-cell response we evaluated the effect of DA in T-cell activation as secretion of IL-2 after anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulation.\\nIn conclusion, our data shows that T-cells express functional dopamine receptors in an activation-dependent manner.\\nOn this line we hypothesized that the possible link between MS and EBV could be ascertained from the study of the frequency of EBV-specific CD8+ T cells in MS patients in different stages and time points of the disease compared to healthy donors.\\nIn particular, we found that the number of CD25high Treg cells expressing the ectonucleotidase CD39 is significantly reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of MS patients compared to healthy donors.\\nThe role of CD4 cells in MS and in its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), has been extensively studied.\\nNevertheless, recent studies have shown that CD8 cells have the capacity to access the CNS as these cells have been found in parenchyma of active lesions of MS patients and EAE animals.\\nThe study presented, examines the expression of component parts of the AM receptors in primary human T cells and the effect of AM and GC on that expression.\\nErasmus MC, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands Introduction: One of the first validated single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with an increased risk for multiple sclerosis was the IL-7Ra. However, limited information is available on the expression of this receptor in different lymphocyte subsets and a possible differential signalling capacity in MS compared to healthy controls (HC).\\nAim of the study: To determine whether frequencies and expression levels of the IL-7Ra on functional T-cell subsets differs between MS patients and healthy controls.\\nMS patients showed a significantly stronger increase of phophorylated STAT5 in CD8EM T-cells compared to healthy controls (p b 0.05) when stimulated with IL-7 independently of CD127 membrane expression.\\nIn order to understand the potential role of T cells in NMO pathogenesis and to develop a model of NMO, we have been studying T cell recognition of AQP4 in NMO patients and in mice.\\nInterestingly, down-modulation of the co-stimulatory signal CD28 on T cells and induction of forkhead transcription factor 3 (FoxP3) expressions on Treg and Ts suggest an attempt to inhibit the self-antigen effector CD4 and CD8 specific response and thus control the inflammatory activity of disease.\\nUltimately, the results of these studies could lead to the development of miR-29 as a biomarker in T cell-mediated diseases such as MS.\\nThis study aims to characterize the level of GrB expression and assess the cytotoxic effect of T cell subsets on human neurons, with special emphasis on Tregs.\\nHuman lymphocytes were activated by anti-CD3 antibody before or after negative/positive selection into CD4+, CD8+ or CD4+CD25+ T cell subsets using magnetic separation.\\nThese results suggest, that in spite of the pathological role of myelin-reactive Tcell in MS the cells may also be associated with beneficial effects on regenerative processes in the brain.\\nEAE induced by active immunization was more severe in PSGL-1 −/− mice, whereas Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG)35-55specific T cells obtained from PSGL-1 −/− mice transferred a more severe disease than WT cells, suggesting a role for PSGL-1 in regulatory mechanisms during EAE.\\nAs CD4+ T cells isolated form WT and PSGL-1 −/− mice displayed similar proliferative response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, we studied the role of PSGL-1 in the suppressor activity exerted by CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells in EAE, by using two-photon laser microscopy (TPLM).\\nIt leads us better understanding for the structures involved in T cell homing and antigen presentation, that potentially qualify as new and selective therapeutic targets in brain autoimmune disease.\\nMany autoimmune chronic inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis, have been previously reported as Th1-mediated disorders; however recent data suggests that Th17 cells are responsible for disease.\\nSince CD1 expression has a direct bearing on our strategic expansion of patient derived glycolipid reactive T cells and more significantly, for the presentation of brain derived glycolipids within the CNS, this matter was further investigated.\\nFurther studies will address the frequency of glycolipid reactive T cells in blood and CSF of MS and other neurological disease controls with possible correlations to antiglycolipid antibody levels.\\nThe blockade of different intracellular signaling pathways all result in a comparable inhibition of about 50% K2P5.1 up-regulation on mRNA level upon T cell stimulation.\\nperipheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), lymph nodes, intraepithelial lymphocytes of intestine, splenocytes and thymocytes of 25 Wistar rats with induced EAE and 12 control animals as well as PBMC from 26 patients with relapsing-remitting MS and 17 healthy donors were used as material.\\nAnalysis of an extensive human cohort also demonstrated association of certain haplotypes within the first intron of the gene with MS, and increased levels of VAV1 mRNA were found in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients as compared to matched controls (published results*).\\nImmunofluorescence studies showed that cells exposition to NMO patients\\' sera for 1 h at 4°C (to restrict membrane fluidity) resulted in IgG binding to the plasma membrane in a linear pattern that colocalized with AQP4, while serum IgG from controls did not bind significantly.\\nIn contrast, after exposure for 12 h at 37°C, NMO patients\\' sera containing AQP4 specific IgG resulted in disappearance of AQP4 fluorescence from the plasma membrane while control sera had no effect on AQP4 expression.\\nNMO patients\\'sera IgG has a selective pathogenic effect on cell membranes expressing AQP4.\\nThe aim of the present study was to analyze neuroendcrine and inflammatory changes in the circulation, and the mRNA expressions of parameters of oxidative stress in the hippocampus before clinical manifestation of the inflammatory disease, on days 2 and 4 after cFA administration and in control male Lewis rats.\\nRemarkably, T cells seem to play a central role already in the orchestration of the initial immune response, since the activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages is decreased in Rag mice.\\nThe further characterization of the immunological mechanisms of the postischemic inflammation will provide valuable insights into the role of different immune cell population and their activation and modulation by cytokine pathways.\\nIts determination is hindered by the presence of CNS-specific T cells in healthy individuals, but above all by the fact that the immune response in MS is composite and varies over time.\\nFibroblasts from FADD knockout mice are completely resistant to death receptor (DR)-mediated apoptosis, and thymocytes from FADD knockout chimeric mice display reduced proliferation in response to mitogens, indicating that the FADD-signaling pathway also plays a role in T cell development and activation.\\nIn TBI, VRA1 leads to higher expression of GSTA4 in the brain and lower levels of histidine-conjugated 4-HNE in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measured with ELISA and in a pilot MOG-induced EAE experiment VRA1 regulates disease severity.\\nOur laboratory is interested in the relationship between the alpha7 nAChR and ASDs because genome-wide association studies link the alpha7 nAChR to ASDs; post-mortem analyses of specific regions of ASD patient brains show an increase in alpha7 nAChR levels; and we identified a functional association between nAChRs and neurexins, presynaptic cell adhesion molecules.\\nIn summary, our results indicate that acute treatment with recombinant IL-4 significantly promotes functional recovery after SCI, while IL-13 exerts opposing effects and thus impairs clinical outcome after SCI in vivo although both cytokines share the IL-4Ra. The role of fibroblast growth factor-9 in chronically demyelinated Multiple Sclerosis lesions Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the leading cause of non-traumatic neurological disability among young adults in North America and Western Europe.\\nA low-density microarray study investigating growth factors, cytokines and their receptors in MS lesions (developed and performed at the Max Planck Institute for Neuroimmunology-Mohan and Meinl), revealed an association between the failure of remyelination and an up-regulation of FGF9 expression.\\nIn transgenic mSOD1 mice, wild-type microglia are more neuroprotective than mSOD1 microglia, and the absence of CD4+ T-cells, is associated with faster disease progression, shortened survival, and increased spinal cord expression of markers of microglial activation (NOX2 and TNF-a).\\nCRMP2 level expression was elevated in blood immune cells of patients suffering from retrovirus-induced neuroinflammation and also in lymph node-and brain-isolated immune cells of mice infected with neurotropic viruses (Vuaillat et al., JNI 2007) .\\nInvestigation of CRMP2 in blood immune cells of healthy controls and multiple sclerosis patients showed that CRMP2 was diversely expressed in lymphocytes, natural killers and monocyte subtypes.\\nHowever, recently, there has been much evidence suggesting that non-conventional gd T cells (T-gd) may also contribute to the pathogenesis of EAE because a subset of T-gd constitutively expresses the IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) and responds vigorously to IL-23 by producing inflammatory cytokines.\\nIn this study, we investigated the phenotype and T-cell stimulatory capacity of standard IL-4 immature DC (IL4-iDC) and IL-10-modulated immature DC (IL10-iDC) with respect to antigen-specific production of cytokines and expression of regulatory T-cell markers.\\nWeber Clinical data indicate that anti-CD20 B cell depletion may be effective in treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS).\\nOur study highlights distinct roles for B cells in pathogenesis and regulation of CNS autoimmune disease.\\nMoreover, the increase in activity of cultured mouse macrophages by AmpB was enhanced by simultaneous treatment with another agent known to have effects on monocytoid cells: macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF).\\nSubsequently, activated immune cells produce proinflammatory cytokines which induce the local expression of IFNGR2 as well as major downstream effectors of IFN-g signalling pathways by the attacked myofibers.\\nWe assessed miRNA genome-wide expression profile by microarray analysis on CD4+CD25+high T regulatory cells from 12 MS relapsingremitting patients in stable condition and 14 healthy controls.\\nWe found 23 human miRNAs differentially expressed between Treg CD4+CD25+high cells from MS patients versus healthy donors.\\nThe presence of virus and immune pathology in the CNS and peripheral organs was paralleled by significantly increased expression of various cytokine mRNAs, including IFN-gamma and TNF, as well as of the co-inhibitory molecule B7-H1 (PD-L1 or CD274) mRNA.\\nWhile HLA-E expression was transiently upregulated on all cell types upon polyclonal activation, B cells exhibited a significantly higher upregulation in MS patients compared to healthy controls (p b 0.01).\\nStill, MS patients carrying the GC haplotype showed a significantly lower (p b 0.05) potential to upregulate HLA-E surface expression on T and B cells after activation.\\nMoreover, regulatory markers Foxp3 and CD122 were significantly down regulated (p b 0.05) in NKG2C+CD8+ T cells of MS patients compared to controls.\\nHowever, levels of several cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-17, IL-8, IL-6, and IL-1β are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid of human NMO patients, and the injection of human AQP4 antibodies in a rodent model with T-cell-mediated brain inflammation induces acute NMO lesions.\\nTherefore, we investigated the humoral and cellular immune responses in NMO patients in clinical, immunologic, and pathologic studies.\\nIt has been reported that both human natural and induced TReg exert cytotoxic activity against autologous target cells, which suggests that the perforin/granzyme pathway may be a relevant candidate mechanism for the suppressive function of TReg. During pregnancy, oestradiol (E2) is markedly increased.\\nThe importance of Treg cells has been extensively studied in actively induced Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) models.\\nIn this study, we investigated the functional role of Treg cells in a spontaneous opticospinal EAE mouse model, which develops following interactions between myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) specific T and B cells.\\nUsing myelin-specific TCR transgenic mice in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, we demonstrate that TGF-β elicits differential effects on naïve versus Th1 effector cells.\\nWhen we induced EAE in Sema3E and T-cell specific plexin-D1 deficient mice by immunizing them with MOG-peptides, the clinical onsets of both mutant mice were significantly delayed compared with those of wild-type mice.\\nMolecular analyses revealed that NAADP signaling influences T cell re-activation upon arrival in the nervous tissues: NAADP inhibitor treatment significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN and IL-17.\\nAlthough it is assumed that in autoimmune neuroinflammation, the primary immune response is directed against the myelin sheath, axonal and neuronal injury are already prominent in early disease stages and very likely determine the degree of long-term disability in patients.\\nHere, we provide evidence that TH17 cells, which other studies have already shown to be associated with clinical deficit in EAE (Ivanov et al., 2006) , play a dominant role in direct neuronal injury during disease course.\\nWe investigated the role of immune cells in early neuronal damage processes in animal models of MS by monitoring autoimmune neuroinflammation using two-photon microscopy of living anaesthetized mice.\\nLive-imaging during disease has characterized the neuronal dysfunction as early and potentially reversible, which suggests that immune-mediated disturbances of the neuronal compartment cause relapsing and remitting disability in patients with multiple sclerosis, in addition to conduction blocks as a result of changes to the myelin sheath.\\nThe C-C chemokine receptor CCR4 has an essential role in the development of autoimmune encephalomyelitis and its expression is required on dendritic cells, not on T cells The CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) and its ligands, CCL17 and CCL22, contribute to the pathogenesis of allergic responses and infectious and autoimmune diseases by directing T lymphocyte trafficking to inflammatory sites.\\nThus, therapies targeting CCR4 function in dendritic cells may represent an important strategy in the development of treatments for autoimmune CNS disease.\\nWe use antibody-based microarrays or Luminex technology to measure the relative levels of up to 700 secreted signaling proteins including cytokines and growth factors in plasma from humans and mice and correlate them with molecular and cellular changes in the brain.\\nWe are presently studying how microglial activation and increased proinflammatory cytokine production contribute to EAE-associated synaptic pathology and recovery in the cortex.\\nProteomic analysis and microarray studies of brain lesions, cerebrospinal fluid and immune cells of MS patients have revealed unexpected molecules and pathways involved in the disease pathogenesis and have identified new targets for therapy.\\nIn vivo transplantation studies showed that systemic administration of IL-10 expressing Ad-MSCs, either by intravenous or intraperitoneal injection, during the initiation phase of disease could prevent or significantly delay the development of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE.\\nIn this study, we aimed to confirm the finding that hMSCs inhibit activation of microglia and to identify the specific mechanisms underlying this effect.\\nThe aim of our study was to investigate inflammationinduced changes on the gene expression profile in NSCs. Dark Agouti rats were immunized to develop Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) an MS-like disease model.\\nAdministration of C57B/6 mice derived MSCs at day 90, the time of the first appearance of clinical symptoms, about 20-30 days after the first signs of degeneration of motoneurons, results in a significant improvement of behavioral motor tests and increased survival compared to control animals.\\nRecent reports have shown that the neuroprotective effect of therapeutic Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) may be mediated not only by their ability to inhibit immune responses targeting the central nervous system but also by their capacity to produce trophic factors that may contribute to functional recovery, neuron survival and stimulation of endogenous neural precursors.\\nIn this study we show that the intravenous administration of adiposederived MSC (ASC) in EAE animals with chronic established disease significantly ameliorates the disease course not only by reducing demyelination and axonal loss, but also by inducing Th2-type cytokine shift in antigen-specific T cells.\\nIn conclusion, we show that ASC display clear therapeutic effect in animals with established disease by a bimodal mechanism, by suppressing the autoimmune response as well as by inducing local neuro-regeneration by activating endogenous progenitors.\\nPreliminary results showed that animals injected with ASC after disease onset had significant higher behavioral performance as compared to controls for almost 7 weeks.\\nAntigenic stimulation does not affect PGE2 production following co-cultivation of MSC and PBMC, and only the presence of MSC in cell culture leads to significant increase of PGE2 simultaneously with expressed suppression of myelin-stimulated T cell proliferation in MS patients.\\nIn order to investigate the pathogenic potential of autoantibodies present in patients with MS, we developed an in vitro screening strategy using a myelinating culture system derived from rat embryonic spinal cord in which we can quantify antibody mediated effects on both axons and myelin.\\nIn contrast this demyelinating activity was not observed using IgG prepared from patients with peripheral neuropathies or from the healthy control group.\\nThere is no difference between healthy subjects and MG patients in the frequency of B-cells that express BAFF-R.\\nThese data suggest that there is a higher frequency of activated B-cells in patients with MG.\\nIn naïve and immunized GA-treated mice, B cells expressed lower levels of activation markers CD25 and CD69.\\nFurther characterization of the molecular patterns involved in the migration of specific B cell subpopulations among the different sites of inflammation might provide crucial insights on the pathological mechanism of the disease.\\nDifferential cytokine and CD40L expression in MG is compared with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients and healthy controls (CON) in this study.\\nCD40L gene expression of CD4+T cells was lower in MG (10.0, p = 0.003) and in RA (7.7, p = 0.0001) than in CON (15.5) and this finding also held true in patients without corticosteroid treatments (11.8, p = 0.023 and 6.8, p = 0.0001, respectively).\\nNo other B and T cell cytokine gene expression was different between the groups.\\nThe antigenic targets of the intrathecal B cell response in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) are unknown.\\nTo examine this response and the potential role of B cells in the pathogenesis of MS, we characterized the reactivities of individual clonally expanded antibodies that were expressed in the demyelinating lesions of MS brain.\\nTo compare the breadth of this response to the specificity of antibodies from an inflammatory CNS disease of known cause, we also performed the identical immunoassays with rAbs produced from the brain of a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).\\nSince the mice with actively induced EAE produce both PLP190-209-specific T cells and antibodies, we have investigated the role of antibody in the development of cerebellar lesions in this model.\\nTo analyze the presence and biomarker potential of anti-SPAG16-2 antibodies in MS serum, a recombinant protein ELISA was used for immunoreactivity screening in sera from MS patients (n = 69) and controls (healthy controls, n = 43; inflammatory and non-inflammatory neurological diseases, n = 47).\\nAs a consequence of this altered expression profile, activated microglia were highly sensitized to adenosine-mediated inhibition of subsequent TLR-induced cytokine responses.\\nIn conclusion, we report a differential, activation state-specific expression of ADORA in microglia and uncover a new role for A3R as dynamically regulated suppressors of A2AR-mediated inhibition of TLR-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine responses.\\nThe role of DC in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) has recently received great attention since these cells have been found to be increased in perivascular cuffs, active lesions and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients.\\nWe demonstrate that the distinct myeloid cell populations present in the human CNS, under steady-state or inflammatory conditions, exhibit similar patterns of S1PR expression but distinct signaling and cytokine modulation in response to FTY720-P.\\nBackground: Interleukin (IL)-27 is a cytokine produced by antigen presenting cells with multiple roles in the induction as well as in regulation of the immune responses.\\nMethods: NK cells were isolated from buffy coats of healthy individuals using Mitenyi Beads, sorted into CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells and cultured under different conditions with or without addition of IL-27 to study the potential effects of IL-27 on proliferation, expression of surface markers, transcription factors and cytokine secretion of treated NK cells.\\nWe have studied the inflammatory response in mice following TBI induced by controlled cortical impact.\\nRecently we showed that intranasal VSV instillation of mice selectively lacking the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) on neuroectodermal cells of the CNS resulted in severe encephalitis and death whereas control mice did not show signs of disease (Detje et al., 2009) .\\nIn addition, neutrophils from RRMS patients tended to demonstrate increased expression of molecules involved in antigen presentation (CD86 and HLA-class II).\\nIn conclusion, neutrophils from MS patients do not seem to differ significantly with respect to surface phenotype when compared with healthy controls.\\nIn our current studies, we pursue the putative functional roles of class II and CD86 expression on neutrophils as well as the factors underlying the granulophilia observed in MS patients.\\nIn conclusion, this study reports that TLR-induced pro-inflammatory responses of microglia are similarly enhanced by different types of statins, and that microglia are particularly sensitive to statinmediated effects when compared to other macrophages.\\nIn addition, stimulation by this agonist enhances TGF-β expression by Tregs, suggesting that TLR2 activation may promote Th17 cell differentiation.\\nThese data support the hypothesis that in MS and potentially other immune-mediated diseases, infections may lead to exacerbation of disease activity by causing reduction of Treg suppression and differentiation of pathogenic Th17 cells.\\nInterestingly, preliminary experiments have shown that Imiquimod exacerbates EAE in the absence of pDCs which indicates that the protective effect of Imiquimod is dependent on pDCs. Our data demonstrate that TLR7 agonist Imiquimod and TLR9 agonist CpG type A reduce EAE disease severity and there is a potential for immunotherapy in MS by inducing the expansion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells which then produce IFN-beta which is currently used as a treatment of MS.\\nToll-like receptors (TLRs), members of the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) family, recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and ligand binding activates proinflammatory and antiviral responses on APCs. Central nervous system (CNS)-resident cells, microglia isolated from human and neonatal murine tissue, express multiple TLRs in vitro and in situ.\\nFinally, we analysed clinical expression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in double transgenic mice, where TrkB had been selectively depleted in GFAP positive cells.\\nThe pathogenesis of Alzheimer\\'s disease (AD) is generally attributed to the increased production and accumulation of β-amyloid protein that results in direct neuronal toxicity and in microglial activation which, through the production of inflammatory mediators, contributes to neuronal damage.\\nOur data show a strong correlation between the level of PrPc expression and the survival of RGCs. Furthermore, this neuroprotective function of PrPc was shown to be independent of its role in regulating the immune response.\\nCitrullinated MBP has been demonstrated in degenerative CNS diseases and scrapie.If not the cause, citrullination of MBP may be a facilitator of epitope spreading and worsening of multiple sclerosis (MS): T cell response to citrullinated MBP is stronger in MS compared to control subjects.\\nMoreover, functions that decreased at 15 p.m. in the control group, were stimulated at the same time in the OMT group, reaching similar or higher levels than those at 10 a.m. In conclusion, the results showed that OMT modifies the circadian rhythm of the functions studied in neutrophils and improves the immune response within physiologic limits.\\nWe have followed longitudinally a small cohort of MS patients treated with anti-CD25 antibodies and analyzed the NK cells subsets for the expression of activation markers, adhesion molecules and selected chemokine and cytokine receptors by flow cytometry.\\nPatients treated with anti-CD25 antibodies showed a slight decrease in the absolute numbers of T, NKT and NK cells.\\nThese expanded cells expressed higher levels of IL2 receptor beta (CD122), CD62L and CD127 than the same population in untreated patients or healthy donors.\\nIn summary, we show that both in vitro and in vivo, CD56bright NK cells proliferate in the presence of anti-CD25 blocking antibodies, and these cells express differentially surface markers compared to CD56bright NK cells from untreated MS patients or healthy donors.\\nIn the present study, we compared our previous immunofluorescence detection system with a new ELISA method to perform quantitative analysis of anti-AQP4 levels in NMO patients.\\nIn this study, we have searched for a novel autoantibody in patients with multiple sclerosis and investigate its target tissue and the antigen proteins.\\nTo study the expression and regulation of noggin mRNA in the PBMCs of patients with RR-MS compared to healthy controls.\\nThis potential seems to be defective in immune cells of patients with RR-MS as there is reduced expression levels of noggin mRNA and insufficient stimulatory effect of CD3/CD28 stimulation and non response to TNF-α in these patients.\\nThe data suggest a modulation of the expression of these danger molecules after standard treatment of glioblastoma cells, suggesting that those signals play crucial roles in radiation or chemotherapeutic responses leading to specific and long lasting anti-glioma immune responses.\\nInterestingly, mice deficient of the chemokine receptor CX3CR1 suffered from a more severe form of the disease while showing reduced infiltration of NK cells into the CNS.\\nPreliminary data indicate that mice lacking the receptor on peripheral leukocytes (KO WT chimeras) developed a more severe EAE course and showed reduced infiltration of NK cells compared to mice expressing the receptor only in the CNS (WT KO chimeras).\\nMoreover the current studies will determine if such phagocytosis of neuronal antigens is sufficient to activate NF-L specific T cells present in humans.\\nThese studies should reveal the extent to which macrophages and microglia phagocytose neuronal antigens and whether such uptake is sufficient to activate T cells and thus are an active part of the pathogenic process rather than merely surrogate markers of disease in MS patients.\\nTo investigate the functional importance of T cells in disease progression, brain abscesses were induced in TCR aβ knockout (KO) mice.\\nSpecifically, neutrophil and gd T cell infiltrates were significantly increased in brain abscesses of TCR aβ KO mice compared to WT animals, whereas macrophage infiltrates were reduced in TCR aβ KO mice following S.\\nThe neurotrophin receptor p75NTR regulates human skeletal muscle differentiation, maturation and survival upon inflammatory stress Recent studies in animal models indicate that the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR may be expressed by muscle satellite cells and participate to tissue regeneration.\\nHistopathological evaluation of MS lesions has revealed that APP immunoreactivity is increased in active demyelinating plaques compared to control patients without neurological disease and that APP is induced on reactive glial cells, neurons, and T lymphocytes during demyelination (Gehrmann et al., Glia 15: 141-151,1995) .\\nOur objectives are 1) Investigate the mechanisms by which antibodies and T cells to NF-L generated in mice induce axonal damage in vivo.\\n2) Determine the relationship between autoimmune T cell responses and antibodies to NF-L and disease type, activity and progression in MS.\\nBased on these results, T cell-epitopes will be used to immunize mice and their pathogenic effect will be tested in the EAE model.\\n-To study the role of B cells and Ig in axonal damage, NF-L monoclonal antibodies were generated and the specificity was tested.\\nDisease severity and inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients with NMOSD is associated with disruption of blood brain barrier.\\nC3b (9/9) and C5b9 (6/9 strong, 3/9 weak) were detected on the surface of HEK cells expressing NMDAR clusters in the presence of complement and NMDAR-antibody positive patient sera.\\nDecreased protein levels of FKN have been found in the aged brain, as well as in the plasma of patients with Alzheimers disease.\\nData from this study showed a significant reduction in BrdU+ cells in the FKN null mice compared to WT.\\nIn the present study we use a rapid procedure to isolate and sort, and culture microglia from both MS and healthy control brain donors with high purity from human post-mortem brain tissue, based on density gradients and cell surface expression of CD11b and CD45.\\nIn multiple sclerosis (MS), and in its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), circulating immune cells gain access to the central nervous system (CNS) and cause inflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and demyelination.\\nIn multiple sclerosis (MS), and in its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), circulating immune cells gain access to the central nervous system (CNS) and cause inflammation, blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and demyelination.\\nProinflammatory cytokines produced by virus-specific Th1 cells lead to the recruitment, accumulation, and activation of additional monocytes and macrophages within CNS that cause demyelination through a terminal nonspecific bystander response.\\nIn MS patients, a PD-1 polymorphism was determined to be associated with disease progression, possibly through a partial defect in PD-1-mediated inhibition of T-cell activation.\\nTMEV primarily induced the up-regulation of PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA expression, compared with uninfected DCs. Treatment with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to PD-1, especially during the effector phase, resulted in significant deterioration of the development of this disease both clinically and histologically.\\nThe number of infiltrating mononuclear inflammatory cells in the spinal cords was also increased in mice treated with monoclonal anti PD-1 antibodies.\\nFlow cytometric analysis of cytokine staining revealed that there was significant increase of the number of Th1-derived cytokine producing CD4+ cells such as IFN-gamma in anti PD-1 mAbs treated mice both in spleen and spinal cord.\\nThese benefits were associated to decreased gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines as well as reduced microglia activation in the spinal cord of TMEV-infected mice.\\nThe generation of knock-in mouse for Vav1 will help us to decipher at the cellular and molecular levels the mechanisms by which the Vav1 pathways direct the function of T cells and by which its dysfunction leads to immune diseases.\\nFinally, neutralizing Ninjurin-1 during the course of EAE with either Ninj26-37 blocking peptide or anti-Ninjurin-1 neutralizing antibody, reduced clinical disease activity and histopathological indices of EAE and decreased infiltration of CD11b+ F4/80+ macrophages, CD11b+ CD11c+ dendritic cells and CD45hi CD11b+ Ly6Chi inflammatory APCs into the CNS.\\nT cell responses to antigen priming and cytokine production during the peak of the disease (IFNg, IL-17) were equivalent in all groups.\\nOverall our results suggest an active role of caspase 8 in mediating excitotoxic neuronal death and identify potential new targets for neurodegenerative diseases.\\nThe results of this study demonstrate that infiltrating monocytederived cells are functionally distinct from the inflammatory resident microglia and are essential for recovery.\\nIn this study we examine whether estradiol regulates PAD4 expression and NET formation in human neutrophils and whether there are sex differences in NET formation that could underlie the female prevalence observed in multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune diseases.\\nTLR-mediated activation enhances cell surface expression of costimulatory molecules and induces the production of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines.\\nInterestingly, analysis in bone marrow-derived macrophages and in human monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells showed similar results, suggesting that the proposed effect is not exclusive for microglia.\\nToll-like receptors (TLRs), members of the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) family, recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and ligand binding activates pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses on APCs. Central nervous system (CNS)-resident cells, microglia isolated from human and neonatal murine tissue express multiple TLRs in vitro and in situ.\\nUsing an experimental model of acute brain inflammation, we demonstrated that 17beta-estradiol reduces the activation of brain inflammatory cells in vivo and that this effect is specifically mediated by ERalpha.\\nTo assess the capacity to induce neuronal differentiation, survival, and the activation of the NGF-receptor pathway, the in vitro application of NGF-like molecules on two different cell lines was tested: PC12 (expressing both NGF-receptors TrkA and p75) and RN22 (expressing only the p75 NGF-receptor).\\nIn order to understand better the role of CD4+ JCV-specific T cells in healthy controls, MS patients without and under therapy with natalizumab, we characterized their antigen specificity, phenotype and function before and under natalizumab therapy.\\nUsing the above methods, we observed positive JCV-specific T cell responses in 91.8% of healthy controls and 91.3% of MS patients.\\nHowever, when mice were depleted of their NK cells, the expression of these genes was reduced to basal levels.\\nThis is the first study to investigate the mechanistic changes in NK cell activation and recruitment in glioma following OV treatment.\\n22 The S protein has a major role in the induction of protective immunity during infection with SARS-CoV by eliciting neutralizing-antibodies and T-cell responses.\\nData from animal CoV vaccination suggest that systemic humoral or cell-mediated immune responses induced by parenteral administration may not be adequate to prevent respiratory tract infection.\\nOur results indicate that the Nurr1/CoREST transrepression pathway plays a role in the maintenance of HIV latency in microglial cells, but not in T cells, and works to limit HIV over-expression during inflammation-mediated activation of infected microglial cells in brain.\\nIn the present study we investigated the effect of glutamate-induced activation of NFkappaB in glial cells of the CNS, including primary astrocytes on the regulation of mir-146a and EAAT2 promoter regulation.\\nIn conclusion, these data indicate that exposure to cell free HIV induces biologically relevant changes in neuronal signaling proteins.\\nPathways in which these proteins function can be further studied to better understand the pathogenesis associated with HAND and may represent novel targets for interventions aimed at improving neuronal functioning in HIV patients.\\nTherefore, the aims of our study have been the investigation of the possible JCV reactivation in pediatric CD patients treated or not with infliximab, performing quantitative PCR in urine, plasma, and intestinal biopsies at the time of recruitment (t0) and every 4 months in 1 year of follow-up (t1, t2, and t3), and the analysis of the JCV Non-Coding Control Region (NCCR) sequence to detect cellular transcription factors binding site mutations.\\nOur data on primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM), which we used as an in vitro model for microglial cells show that hBD2 and -3 inhibit HIV at an early stage of infection in association with increased levels of APOBEC3G.\\nWe have reported that strain HCoV-OC43 can infect human neuronal and glial cells, activate neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative mechanisms, thus possibly be involved in neurological disease of unknown etiology, such as multiple sclerosis (MS).\\nWe are studying the effects of bup and CCL2, a chemokine elevated in the CNS of HIV infected people, on junctional proteins of human monocytes and brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMVEC) necessary for monocytes to cross the BBB.\\nWe propose that these cell type-specific differences in type I interferon responsiveness play a key role in the ability of neurons to survive viral infection.\\nStudy Design: One hundred and eighty-six samples [urine, serum, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)] from 62 patients (15.8±6.2 years old) with Crohn\\'s disease, ulcerative colitis or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis treated with immunotherapy or conventional therapy for over 12 months were tested by real time PCR.\\nTaken together our results suggest that METH-induced epigenetic changes in the human brain might be mediated by increase expression of DNMT1.\\nEctopic expression of OPN in a surrogate cell line that does not produce this protein endogenously, OPN was shown to enhance HIV-1 infectivity and replication through a pathway involving the activation of NF-κB binding sites within the HIV-1 promoter.\\nThe purpose of this study was to analyze magnetoencephalography (MEG) data from patients with HIV disease and risk-group appropriate controls to determine the MEG frequency profile during resting state, and its stability over 24 weeks.\\nStudies have demonstrated the accumulation of extracellular human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Vpr in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of HIV-1-infected patients in direct correlation with viral loads and disease progression.\\nFurthermore, although a trend towards upregulation of FHC was seen in neurons cultured without glia and treated with gp120IIIB, IL-1β, or TNF-α, studies performed in the presence of glia suggest a potential role of these cells in the effects of the cytokines.\\nResults: A significant increase was observed in the sIR levels secreted from neuronal cells exposed to the CSF of HIV-infected patients (p < 0.001) compared to HIV(-) controls.\\nOther studies in culture indicate that HIV has evolved mechanisms to disrupt induction of cellular IFN responses, as also suggested by the observed dysregulation of IFN-responsive genes in lymph nodes, peripheral T cells, and brain tissues of HIVinfected patients.\\nOur results show directly that functional type I IFN responses are important but insufficient for control of HIV infection and pathogenesis in the brain.\\nGiven that astrocytes make up 40-70% of brain cells, even low-level infection may contribute significantly to HIV-associated neuropathogenesis.\\nInterferons mediate their effects through activation of STAT1, though we have shown that STAT1 levels in primary mouse neurons are drastically reduced as compared to control fibroblasts, despite the ability of IFN gamma (IFNg) to protect neurons from viral infection.\\nAlterations in brain morphology and function in these conditions are proposed to result from direct influences of infectious agents, or the immune activation they induce, on neuronal proliferation and migration.\\nIn non-neural cells, oxidative stress induces the endogenous antioxidant response (EAR), activating transcription factor Nrf2 which upregulates expression of protective enzymes.\\nMethods and Results: Immunohistochemical analysis of brain sections from a patient with CNS-IRIS demonstrated a presence of T-cells, IL-17+ cells and HIV-Tat but an absence of p24 antigen.\\nConclusions: HIV Tat protein activates T-cells in a novel antigen independent manner leading to an alteration of chromatin state, increased gene transcription, release of cytokines and cytoxic granules and enhanced viral infection.\\nThe similarity of the HIV infection phenotypes in human and mouse CNS cells suggests that EcoHIV is suitable for study of HIV neuropathogenesis in mice.\\nThis data suggests that Vpr may serve an important role in vivo by selectively inhibiting immune activation while stimulating NF-κB mediated viral production in HIV-1 infected T-cells and myeloid cells.\\nIn this study, we treated three myeloid cell lines, Mono-Mac 1, THP-1 and U937 with Sunitinib or a small molecule (cFMS-I) optimized for cFMS inhibitory activity to test the anti-cancer effect in of such treatment.\\nFurther, our data provides an excellent experimental model system for studding the cell-type specificity of JCV T-antigen expression and the role of bone marrow-derived stem cells in the pathogenesis of JCV-related diseases.\\nHERV-K activation has been detected in in the plasma and brains of patients with HIV-1 infection, suggesting that exogenous retroviruses may regulate HERV-K expression.\\nBoth of them were less effective than HIV-1 Rev, but also had additive effects together with Tat. In conclusion, HIV-1 Tat and Rev can significantly up-regulate HERV-K expression, which could be the mechanism of HERV-K activation in HIV-1 infected patients.\\nMicroglia activation and resultant pro-inflammatory responses play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders.\\nThe expression of MSRVenv and syncytin-1 by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from MSRV(+) volunteers and MS patients, and U87-MG astrocytes was studied, by discriminatory env-specific RT-PCR and flow cytometry.\\nAlthough the HTLV-1specific CD8+ cytotoxic T cell response is seen in both pathogenic states, its actual significance in preventing viral load and controlling disease progression remains questionable.\\nIn this study, we compared the expression of 84 key genes involved in inflammasome function in the spleen of HIV-1Tg rats and F344 control animals with and without LPS treatment.\\nPreliminary studies demonstrate that Spi-B is upregulated in developing B cells in response to natalizumab therapy in MS patients, a known risk factor for PML.\\nThese effects may be attributed to the direct interaction of viral proteins with neural cells, or could result from inflammatory processes that accompany viral infection.\\nBy seven days of exposure, H9/IIIB-exposed slices expressed 2-3 fold higher levels of mRNA for genes associated with neuronal structure, as compared with slices cultured in medium alone, or slices exposed to uninfected H9 cells.\\nAim, Material and methods: pro/antinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 Beta, IL-4, TGF Beta), chemokines (CX3CL1 0 Fractalkine) and cell adhesion molecules (NCAM soluble) were quantified by ELISA in a subset of naïve HIV-1 infected patients monitored through 24 and 48 weeks of ART treatment (n055) as compared to their controls.\\nResults and conclusions HIV-1 infection increases MCP-1, fractalkine soluble and PSA-NCAM levels, which were reduced by ART for 48 weeks of treatment; suggesting their usefulness to predict ART efficacy in HIV-1 infected patients.\\nStudies have shown that HIV-infected patients develop neurocognitive disorders characterized by neuronal dysfunction.\\nThe viral protein R, a protein encoded by HIV-1, has been shown to alter the expression of various important cytokines and inflammatory proteins in infected and uninfected cells, however the mechanisms involved remain unclear.\\nResults: A total of 114 patients with HIV were included although 106 completed all study assessments.\\nIn this study, we investigated the contribution of humoral immune responses in control of MCMV brain infection.\\nResults obtained during these studies showed a steady increase in the recruitment of Blymphocyte-lineage cells into the brain throughout the timecourse of viral infection.\\nFinally, using B-cell deficient (Jh-/-) mice we demonstrated that B lymphocytes control recovery of reactivated virus from latently-infected brain tissue.\\nCON-CLUSION: Taken together, these results demonstrate that MCMV infection triggers accumulation and persistence of Blymphocyte-lineage cells within the brain which produce antibodies and play significant role in controlling reactivated virus.\\nTo examine this hypothesis we are studying the effects of cytokines on autophagy in a neuronal cell culture model, combining cytokine treatment with methamphetamine.\\nIn the present study, we demonstrate that exposure of human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y to HIV transactivator protein, Tat resulted in decreased intrinsic expression of PDGF-CC as evidenced by RT-PCR and western blot assays.\\nIn conclusion, age, in the context of HIV-1 infection, appears to impact viral gene expression and immune activation.\\nTo further test this hypothesis and evaluate potential clinical implications, we measured protein expression of FHC, CXCR4 and pCXCR4 (Ser 339 -as indication of receptor status) within brain tissue samples from control subjects, illicit drug abusers (including opiate users), and HIV + patients by multispectral immunohistological image analysis.\\nOur results demonstrate elevated FHC protein and decreased pCXCR4 expression within digitally isolated cortical neurons of patients with a history of drug use or HIV.\\nSpecifically, morphine treatment of HEK293 cells overexpressing MOR-1X resulted in an increased level of phosphorylated GSK3beta and a decreased level of Bax. This data suggests that multiple factors, including opioid abuse, alters the expression of MOR isoforms and that this alteration may have functional consequences, particularly in HIV neuropathogenesis, by altering apoptotic pathways.\\nHIV-1 infection provokes immune activation of macrophages enhancing migration to the brain and secretion of neurotoxins affecting glial cells and neurons.\\nResults published from this cohort indicated significant increases in brain viral load and altered natural killer cell immune responses with no effect of METH on blood viral load.\\nThese results provide an indication of the usefulness of specifically targeting CB2 activation for controlling HIV-1 pathogenesis.\\nConclusions: Further studies of proinflammatory responses and effects of HIV protein expression, and activation of CD38 and cellular oxidases in the HIV TG model may provide clues for developing treatment approaches for cognitive impairment resulting from HIV infection in humans.\\nThese results suggest that γδ T cells have a protective effect on HTLV-1-infected individuals.\\nEffects of SP / neurokinin-1 receptor binding in nestin + human fetal brain cells Children perinatally infected with HIV-1+ are at increased risk to develop neurocognitive deficits and behavioral /psychiatric disorders.\\nUnderlying cellular mechanisms may include the effects of HIV-associated neuroinflammation on cells critical for brain development, specifically nestin positive neural progenitors and astroglia with progenitor potential.\\nResults suggest that nonexpressing clones within monocytic cell lines cannot be induced to express under all conditions examined.\\nOn the other hand, 2 weeks treatment with HU-308, attenuates inflammatory disease progression by limiting microglia activation and proliferation and reducing BrdU + cell destruction by phagocytosis.\\nIn this study, a human brain microvascular endothelial cell (hBMEC) line, hCMEC/D3, was used to establish an in vitro transwell model of the BBB to investigate the effects of chronic (24, 48, or 72 h) morphine treatment on barrier structure and function.\\nWhile, exhausted CD8+ T cells expressed high levels of PD-1 in chronic viral infections, the blockade of this pathway resulted in increased expansion of activated viral specific T cells.\\nResults PD-1 expression was elevated on total CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells (medians 36% and 24%) in PML patients compared to healthy control subjects (medians 14% and 18%; p00.0015 and p00.033).\\nThe oncogenic activity of JCV is attributed to the viral early gene products, large T and small t antigens, as evident by results from in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal studies.\\nTo further supplement our findings, we also studied the correlation between AEG-1 expression and brain aging, one of the many factors responsible for astrogliosis under disease-free conditions.\\nIn conclusion, this study suggest that AEG-1 may play a role in protecting human astrocytes from oxidative damage induced during reactive astrogliosis and increase their migratory and proliferative potential following injury.\\nYet little is known about the role of MA in the expression of neurocognitive compromise during the acute and early stages of HIV infection (AEH), which is associated with rapid viral replication, increased immune activation, and alterations in brain metabolism.\\nConclusion: This study provides evidence of an antigen-induced origin of Tregs trafficking into the CSF from AIDS-associated CM patients and reveals their immune inhibitory capability on LT CD8+ critical for controlling CM.'"
